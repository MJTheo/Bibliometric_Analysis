AB  - Based on different theoretical and publishing approaches, this study reveals that the publication of bibliometric articles in business and management follows a logistic diffusion pattern. Fist, the analysis of citation concentration −using the Gini index, concludes that a minority of articles capture most scholarly interest, there is a moderate concentration of articles in some outlets, and a large and diverse group of authors, forming a long tail distribution. Second, a set of hypotheses are tested by alternative regression models (OLS, semi-logarithmic, and negative binomial models). Results support the importance of specific characteristics such as the synthesis of previous contributions, the methodological sophistication, or the cosmopolitanism of the collaboration of the authors. In addition, there is an inverse effect of bibliometric expansibility on the impact of each article. The authors built a database from a content analysis of 835 bibliometric articles in WoS (1981–2022). The results raise several implications and recommendations. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The practice of child marriage (CM) has become a significant global concern, severely impacting children’s well-being. This study employs bibliometric analysis and content analysis to identify global publication trends on CM and effectively address the research gaps in this field. The study used the Scopus database from 1994 to 2021. This research can be seen from the number of publications and citations that tend to increase. The United States, India, and the United Kingdom are the countries with the most influential authors, affiliates, articles, and publication performance. Compared with the three countries, not many authors from Asia have been published on the topic; however, some countries in Asia have more child marriages. This research review shows that articles on CM mainly discuss the drivers and impacts of CM and its intervention efforts. With traditional and cultural practice, health, and reproductive rights, CM is related to human rights and the effects of CM intergenerational relationships. This study suggests that future research focuses on (i) CM policies, (ii) the participation and agency of the child to reduce CM, and (iii) CM with refugees for humanitarian context as a matter of CM occurring. © (2025), (Journal of Population and Social Studies).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The development of artificial intelligence in the medical field is rapidly advancing, with increasing research on its applications in the field of bone trauma. Through bibliometric analysis, this paper analyzed the research hotspots of artificial intelligence in the field of bone trauma in recent years, and predicted the future research trend. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the development history, research status, hot spots, and future development trends of artificial intelligence technology in the field of bone trauma to provide new insights for future research. METHODS: This study selected relevant literature from the Web of Science core database, covering the period from the inception to August 2023, and retrieved 420 articles related to the application of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning in the field of bone trauma. After manual screening, 202 articles related to this article were exported, and Citespace software was used for visual analysis of cooperation of countries, institutions, cited journals, citation analysis, keyword co-occurrence, and other aspects. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) The overall number of publications from the 202 selected articles showed an upward trend, indicating significant research potential for future studies. The country with the highest centrality and the highest publication volume was the United States. The University of California (USA) was the most prolific research institution. (2) The top five most commonly used keywords in bone trauma research using artificial intelligence were deep learning, artificial intelligence, bone density, machine learning, and diagnosis. The keyword with the highest centrality was bone density, and the keyword with the highest frequency was deep learning. (3) The top 10 most cited reference papers provided comprehensive insights into the feasibility of applying artificial intelligence techniques to the diagnosis of bone trauma from various perspectives. Among them, eight papers focused on bone and joint injuries and deep convolutional neural networks. One paper discussed the use of deep learning in detecting osteoporosis in CT scans to prevent fragility fractures, while another paper explored the correlation between the application of artificial intelligence in identifying changes in skin texture and the recognition of bone characteristics. (4) In the future, the research hotspots of artificial intelligence will mainly focus on the specific study of fractures caused by bone and joint trauma and osteoporosis. The research trend mainly focuses on improving the performance of artificial intelligence algorithms, using new artificial intelligence technologies to accurately classify and quickly and efficiently diagnose bone injuries, especially for the diagnosis of complex and hidden fractures. By establishing finite element analysis models, more standardized evaluations of bone injuries can be achieved. © 2025, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

AB  - Food preservation and safety are critical issues in the food industry. Preservatives play an essential role in controlling pathogenic and spoiling microorganisms in food. However, there is growing concern about the current means of food preservation, which are usually synthetic preservatives, and these are directly related to certain types of disease. Biopreservation is a modern food preservation technique that has a direct effect on the control of food-borne microorganisms. It uses natural antimicrobials, which can be obtained from different sources such as bacteria, animals, and plants. This study aims to provide an overview of different natural preservatives applied in food biopreservation, including bacteriocins, chitosan, essential oils, and plant extracts, with the aid of bibliometric tools to investigate influential publications and research trends in this field. Through different bibliometric tools, it was possible to observe that food biopreservation showed an exponential increase in studies from 2003 to 2023, highlighting the importance of this topic in the food industry. Bibliometric analysis also showed that the use of bacteriocins in food biopreservation is widespread in the literature due to their non-toxicity, thermal resistance, and broad activity. Chitosan and enzymes were also identified in the bibliometric tools as being widely used in food preservation research, as well as essential oils. Research trends have shown that biological molecules such as carotenoids and anthocyanins have remarkable antimicrobial potential against food-borne pathogens. The paper highlights essential approaches to the use of natural antimicrobials, demonstrating a growing search in this field, that could provide helpful information for the food industry and help optimize the use of these natural agents in food. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Catalytic purification of sulphur-containing malodorous gases has attracted wide attention because of its advantages of high purification efficiency, low energy consumption and lack of secondary pollution. The selection of efficient catalysts is the key to the problem, while the preparation and optimisation of catalysts depend on the analysis of experimental results and in-depth mechanistic analysis. By analysing the published literature, bibliometric analysis can identify existing research hotspots, the areas of interest and predict development trends, which can help to identify hot catalysts in the catalytic purification of sulphur-containing odours and to investigate their catalytic purification mechanisms. Therefore, this paper uses bibliometric analysis, based on Web Of Science and CNKI databases, CiteSpace and VOS viewer software to collate and analyse the literature on the purification of sulphur-containing odour pollutants, to identify the current research hotspots, to summarise the progress of research on the catalytic purification of different types of sulphur-containing odours, and to analyse their reaction mechanisms and kinetics. On this basis, the research progress of catalytic purification of different kinds of sulfur odour is summarized, and the reaction mechanism and dynamics are summarized. © 2023

AB  - With the advancement of Technology, it has become imperative for H.R. and recruitment strategies to adapt. This paper will highlight the emerging trends in H.R. and Recruitment driven by Technology. One prominent trend in H.R. Technology is the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence (A.I.). A.I. is already utilized to streamline and automate H.R. processes like resume screening, interview scheduling, and performance reviews. Looking ahead, A.I. is anticipating a significant impact on H.R. by aiding organizations in making better hiring decisions, designing personalized training programs, and fostering more engaging employee experiences. Another notable trend in H.R. Technology revolves around the transition towards cloud-based platforms. These platforms offer advantages over on-premises systems, including scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. As a result of the various benefits brought by Technology, we would bring about the critical themes in the form of the strategies that the organizations should adopt to enhance their productivity in Recruitment and selection with the help of bibliometric analysis, thematic analysis, ISM (interpretive structuring model) and MICMAC analysis. © 2025 Malque Publishing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vertigo is closely related to clinical neurological disorders. When neurons are damaged or dead, it may lead to abnormalities in the vestibular system and trigger vertigo symptoms. Therefore, it is necessary to explore and analyze the hotspots related to vertigo that are common in clinical neurology. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the vertigo-related histopathological changes in clinical neurology and the research hotspots worldwide using bibliometric methods. METHODS: The WanFang database and Web of Science core set database were searched by the first author to retrieve the research-related literature published from 2014-2023 on the treatment of common vertigo in clinical neurology. A bibliometric analysis of the number of publications, country/region, institution, keywords, co-cited literature, and highly cited literature was peformed using VOSviewer_1.6.19 software to summarize the research hotspots in this research field. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Web of Science core set database had the highest number of 174 publications in this field in 2022, and WanFang database had the highest number of 133 publications in this field in 2020. The top 3 countries with the highest number of publications are the United States, Germany, and China. The University of Munich, Germany is the international institution with the highest number of publications in this field, while Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine is the Chinese institution with the highest number of publications in this field. The results of keyword analysis showed that the research hotspot diseases in this field in China are mainly Meniere’s disease, cervical vertigo, senile vertigo, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, isolated vertigo, and hypertensive vertigo, and the treatments include acupuncture, rehabilitation, medication (gastrodin, Banxia Baizhu Tianma Tang), and manipulative reduction. International research hotspot diseases in this field mainly include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular disorders in new coronavirus cases, Meniere’s disease, vestibular schwannoma, acoustic neuromas, and vestibular migraines, etc., and the hotspot treatments are antivertiginous medications, antidepressant and anxiolytic treatments, and microsurgery. The results of literature co-citation analysis showed that for acute vestibular syndrome with persistent vertigo as the main symptom, three-step bedside ophthalmoscopy (HINTS: Head-Impact-Nystagmus-Strabismus Test) is more sensitive than early MRI in the diagnosis of combined strokes in patients with acute vestibular syndrome, which is the most peer-recognized method of detecting strokes in vestibular syndrome, whereas hormonal therapy is more effective to treat vestibular neuritis patients with paroxysmal vertigo as the main symptom. The results of highly cited literature analysis showed that, in the hot literature included in WanFang database in the past 10 years, acupuncture at Fengchi point and the acupuncture method of inducing resuscitation to improve posterior circulation ischemic vertigo have achieved certain results. The literature published in the past 3 years has indicated that Ginkgo biloba leaf extract+gastrodin, acupuncture+Banxia Baizhu Tang, betahistine+gastrodin, vestibular rehabilitation training+Epley Maneuver, all can improve the vertigo symptoms to different degrees. While there were no featured anti-vertigo drugs indicated in the literature in the Web of Science core set data in the recent 10 years, and most of them are based on traditional anti-vertigo drugs and microsurgery. However, there are a few case reports in the international literature in the last 3 years that found that COVID-19 infection may lead to vestibular neuritis and vertigo symptoms. The onset and progression of vertigo may be closely related to neuronal damage and regeneration. For example, viral infections, inflammatory stimuli, or other pathologic factors may lead to neuronal damage or death, thereby affecting the function of the vestibular system. Vertigo-related diagnosis and treatment standardization guidelines have been published both domestically and internationally. Currently, international guidelines recommend the combination of vestibular rehabilitation and physical rehabilitation for the treatment of vertigo, and Chinese guidelines recommend the combination of Chinese and Western medicine, reduction and acupuncture. However, the level of evidence is not very high, so a large number of large-sample, multicenter randomized controlled trials on anti-vertigo treatment are needed in the future. © 2024, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

AB  - Library and Information Science, along with research in the domain, is rapidly changing in South Africa. Building on related studies and my experiential knowledge as a LIS academic for more than three decades, this paper reflects on the changing trends challenges and opportunities of library and information science research in South Africa to inform future developments in the discipline for strategic interventions. A phenomenological design is used for self-reflection together with a content analysis by bibliometric and review of related studies to inform and shape the content of this paper. The reviewed studies by publication count analysis reflect average presence and visibility of LIS academics in popular international indexing databases that are known for indexing the largest number of research as a whole and LIS, as most research output still occur in local journals that are not indexed by the global databases. LIS research publication trends show insignificant incremental growth while research is slowly shifting to non-traditional LIS research subjects which are technology driven. While research collaboration in LIS in South Africa has grown admirably well beyond 50% and is steadily expanding, most collaborations still occur within institutions, which is contrary to global trends. Challenges relate to LIS research capacity building, insufficient visibility of LIS academics/faculties as a whole and on university or institutional websites, inter-institutional and inter-national research collaboration as well as indexing gaps, rendering searching cumbersome. The research development and support in South Africa offer wonderful opportunity to research sustainability and growth. The paper provides some insight for LIS research development in South Africa. The findings may also interest research in LIS outside the region. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Over recent years, global supply chains have faced an uncertain and extremely dynamic environment, making them more vulnerable to disruptions. To cope with the challenges imposed by this environment, supply chain members have been forced to change their operating modes, and render them more resilient. Digital transformation by implementing advanced technologies has been recognized as one of the cornerstones of this change. The Internet of Things (IoT) is one such technology that enables improved supply chain visibility contributing to increased resilience. The contribution of IoT to supply chain resilience reinforcement has been discussed in numerous papers. Our study seeks to visually map research at the nexus of IoT and supply chain resilience using a bibliometric approach with the aid of VOSviewer software. The findings show that this line of research has generated considerable scholarly attention, mainly since 2020, and has global coverage. Moreover, the keyword co-occurrence visualization highlights that the literature recognizes IoT as an essential component of Industry 4.0 technologies impacting favorably supply chain resilience, and it could be integrated with other advanced technologies, mainly blockchain technology, to give more benefits. The study could help scholars researching and publishing on the investigated topic, providing them with a visualized overview of the existing literature on it. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - This research aims to determine the compounds produced from the pyrolyzed Low Linear Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC MS). We used pyrolysis of 985 g of 2-mm diameter LLDPE plastic ore at a temperature between 192-194°C for 135 min using a batch reactor (length x width x height = 35 cm x 24 cm x 44 cm) equipped with an outlet connected to two condensers (24°C). To ensure the chemical results, the reactor was connected in series to condensers 1 and 2. The results obtained in condenser 1 were 3 mL of 2-phase liquid with a strong odor. The upper fluid is yellow, and the lower fluid is brown. In condenser 2 (connected directly to condenser 1), 4 mL of yellow single-phase liquid was produced with a strong odor. The liquid obtained from the pyrolysis process was then analyzed by FTIR and GC-MS. FTIR results on both samples showed that the samples contained the functional groups O-H, CH₂, and C=O. The GC-MS results on condenser sample 2 showed that the pyrolysis product contained acetone compounds. This confirmed that pyrolysis caused chemical structural changes in LLDPE due to LLDPE chain bond-breaking reactions, producing many smaller chemical compounds. Additionally, some oxidation happens, which is due to the oxygen content in the reactor. This study provides new insights into the LLDPE pyrolysis mechanism and the physical and chemical properties of the liquid resulting from the pyrolysis process. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

AB  - Introduction: Peer-reviewed journals are commonly used by health professionals, including radiographers to disseminate their research products. Understanding patterns like productivity and collaboration of authorship is crucial, enabling relevant stakeholders to chart better directions for professional journals. This bibliometric analysis updates previous works to explore current trends in authorship and collaborations within radiography professional journals. Methods: This study was conducted on three radiography professional journals with predetermined eligibility criteria, investigating publications within a 10-year period (January 2013 - December 2022). Relevant data were collected and analysed both descriptively and using collaboration metrics. Results: There were 1830 papers published across all journals and a linear increase in papers published per year, an average increase of 14.98 %. There are 1330 unique first authors publishing across all journals, however, 79.02 % (1051/1330) of unique authors only published a single paper. Academic authors published the most (55.36 %; 1013/1830) and had the most representation on a list of most published authors (15/20). There were 74 unique countries publishing across all journals and increase noted from international contributions, from 12.22 % in 2013 to 50.36 % in 2022. However, publications of authors from the host countries (UK, Canada, and Australia) of the journals predominates, and along with authors from the USA and Ireland, published 69.29 % of overall papers. There was good collaboration among authors with an average increase of 20.51 % across the years. Clinical-academics are more likely to publish in collaboration (32.93 %; 55/167). Conclusions: Authors from academia still predominate in research productivity compared to those in the clinical, however the increased collaboration noted from clinical-academic authors shows the potential to close this gap in the future. More work is needed to encourage more international authorship contributions to radiography professional journals. © 2024

AB  - Background Ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSCs) are illnesses that can be prevented from resulting in hospitalization with timely and effective ambulatory care. As the global emphasis on improving healthcare service quality and efficiency increases, understanding the evolution and research trends of ACSCs becomes increasingly vital. Objective To analyze the research hotspots, frontiers, and trends in the field of ACSCs over the past 30 years. Methods The English literature related to ACSCs published in the Web of Science was searched in March 2023. CiteSpace was utilized to perform a visualization analysis of the publication year, authors, research institutions, keywords and references extracted from the identified articles. The time frame was set from 1992 to 2023, with each time segment spanning five years. The network node correlation strength was determined using the "Cosine"algorithm. For the analysis, "Author""Institution"and "Keyword"were selected as nodes, resulting in knowledge maps that illustrate co-occurrence among authors, institutions, and keywords. Results From an initial pool of 1 701 articles, 1 698 were ultimately selected for analysis by CiteSpace. Research focusing on ACSCs had generally shown an upward trend in recent years. The top three prolific institutions were Harvard University [81 articles (4.77%) ], University of California [63 articles (3.71%) ] and University of Michigan [47 articles (2.77%) ]. Eight topic clusters were derived from keyword cluster mapping, namely "nursing home""public health""primary care""integrated care""impact""potentially avoidable hospitalizations""management", and "performance". Citation analysis showed that highly cited studies in this field focused on the status of avoidable hospitalizations, influencing factors, healthcare relationships, and reduction strategies. Conclusion Over the past 30 years, research in the field of ACSCs has rapidly progressed and is extensively utilized by major developed nations worldwide to evaluate and improve healthcare services. However, there is a lack of cross-regional collaboration among researchers and institutions, and research interests continually evolve. The main themes include the significance and policy implications of ACSCs and hospitalization for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSH), influencing factors, practical applications, and policy insights. Domestic exploration of these crucial areas is insufficient and requires more attention in the future. © 2024 Chinese General Practice. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study critically examines the literature on sustainable education spaces via bibliometric analysis. The context is a compilation of the Web of Science (WoS) database publications. Analyses include the distribution of the publications by years; countries with high broadcasting rates, journals, and universities; authors and high rates of cited publications; distribution of publications by WoS categories; research areas, and keywords. The conduction of analyses was via VoSviewer and Carrot2 applications. The results show that the studies in this area increased significantly after 2017. Most studies were from China and America, and most were in the “green sustainable science technologies” field. Studies in the fields of architecture and education emerged less during the examinations. Later, there is an investigation of the relationship between the concepts of sustainability, education, and architecture. Consequently, there is a gap in studies in which education, architecture, and sustainability disciplines are together. More studies must be conducted to fill the gap. This study can help develop future studies in the design of sustainable education environments. © 2025 Common Ground Research Networks. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ossification of the ligamentum flavum was previously considered to be rare in the population. As research has progressed, its incidence rate is increasing gradually, which has aroused the interest of a large number of researchers. OBJECTIVE: To visualize and analyze the research results on ossification of the ligamentum flavum from the Web of Science Core Collection since 1999 using bibliometric methods, and to review the research history of ossification of the ligamentum flavum, highlighting important literature, summarizing research hotspots, and providing ideas for researchers to find research directions. METHODS: Using the Web of Science Core Collection as the data source, relevant papers on ossification of the ligamentum flavum were searched and screened. VOSviewer 1.6.19 and CiteSpace 6.2.R6 were used to conduct the visual analysis of annual publication volume, research countries, institutions, citations, journals, authors, and keywords. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) A total of 347 papers were included. Since 1999, the number of published papers has increased in a spiral pattern. China’s research started later than Japan’s, but the number of publications has come up later, with Peking University being the institution with the most publications, and Prof. Chen Zhongqiang from Peking University being the scholar with the most publications. (2) Five of the 10 most frequently cited publications were related to the surgical treatment of the disease. (3) Excluding keywords directly related to the research topic and synthetically analyzing frequencies and betweenness centralities of key words, terms such as “thoracic myelopathy,” “dural ossification,” “minimally invasive surgery,” and “ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament” occupied a central position in this field. (4) Keywords clustering analysis showed that clinical manifestations and surgical treatment of ossification of the ligamentum flavum accounted for a large proportion of study. (5) The timeline and burst analysis of keywords revealed that “minimally invasive surgery” appeared as a keyword around 2015, with the highest burst strength and the latest burst start time, and began to receive extensive attention from researchers in 2019. The burst of the keyword “dural ossification” has not yet ended. (6) Surgical treatment for ossification of the ligamentum flavum has been at the forefront of research. Development and research of minimally invasive surgery and research on dural ossification secondary to ossification of the ligamentum flavum are both current research hotspots and possible future research trends. © 2025, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

At the macro level, almost every country in the world is experiencing an increase in expenditure on education investment while at the micro level, families are placing greater emphasis on education, with household spending on education rising annually as well. As education plays a crucial role in shaping human capital and driving socioeconomic development, investments in this field have become a prominent focus in academic discourse. Over the past two decades, research on educational investment has expanded rapidly, making it challenging to fully grasp the scope of the developments. Numerous studies have explored various aspects of the topic, such as the impact of parental involvement, policy interventions, and market dynamics on education outcomes. The objective of this study is to compile and analyze research on educational investment from 2004 to 2024. To achieve this, a bibliometric analysis was employed, providing a comprehensive overview of the subject. The results reveal a significant growth in the number of academic articles and citations over the last 20 years. Furthermore, the study identifies the most prolific authors and academic journals contributing to the discourse on educational investment. The keyword co-occurrence analysis highlights five major thematic clusters: education, human capital, parental involvement, policy, and market. The frequent occurrence of certain terms suggests strong interconnections among key concepts. This study offers valuable insights for future scholars and policymakers, laying the groundwork for addressing emerging challenges and shaping future directions in the field of educational investment. By mapping thematic trends and identifying influential contributors, this research serves as a guide for deeper academic exploration and more informed policy decision-making. © 2025, Malque Publishing.

AB  - The selection of a learning model is very crucial before the teacher carries out learning activities. Inquiry is a learning model that has existed for a long time and is recommended for use in learning activities. This study aims to map the results of studies related to inquiry learning in elementary schools. Bibliometrics is used as a method to map previous research. Data was obtained through the Scopus website from 2018–2022, and 143 datasets were obtained. Data analysis uses VosViewer software, which maps the data. The results revealed that the two authors have the highest total strength among the other documents. Meanwhile, based on sources, the International Journal of Science Education is the source with the highest link strength, and the Journal of Instruction is the source that is most widely cited. The Netherlands is the country with the highest number of connections, with 19 documents. Based on the author's curriculum keywords, reading dialogue, science education, and primary education are the most used keywords in 2021. Meanwhile, "narrative inquiry," "science teaching," and "professional teaching" are the least used keywords. The conclusion of this research is that inquiry is still one of the choices used in learning activities. © 2025, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gathering data from previous research and incorporating it into a scientometrics investigation can provide valuable insights into a particular area of study. Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) is currently popular for producing customized metal products quickly. Despite this, there have been lack of studies on implementing stress relief heat treatment after the manufacturing process to reduce residual stress in the resulting parts potentially. This paper represents the first bibliometric analysis study focusing on the application of stress-relief heat treatment as a post-processing method for wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). Given the exploratory nature of this research, it is expected that future investigations will continue to delve into these areas, ultimately contributing to a better understanding of the effects of stress-relief heat treatment on the additively manufactured materials. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

AB  - With the development of industry and agriculture, heavy metals (HMs) and organic pollutants (OPs) have become significant threats to both the ecological environment and human health. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), possessing large specific surface areas, low Ksp, ultrastable mineralization effects, easily modified surfaces and anion embedding characteristics, have distinct advantages in treating HMs and OPs. Utilizing the CiteSpace software and the Web of Science database, we conducted co-occurrence, cocitation, and cluster analyses of 2571 papers published from 2014 to 2023. The most productive countries were China, the United States, India, Iran and Saudi Arabia, among which the largest number of Chinese publications was 1432, accounting for 55.70%, far greater than that of other countries. Seven out of the top 10 institutions were from China, with the Chinese Academy of Sciences leading with 168 papers. Cr(VI), Cd(II), tetracycline and malachite green have attracted considerable attention recently and are anticipated to remain under the spotlight. Challenges impacting the swift progress of LDHs were outlined. This work offers researchers scientific insights into the field's trajectory, enabling them to delve deeper into the underlying mechanisms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This bibliometric review sourced 166 articles on Alternative Routes to Teaching (ARTs) from Web of Science published in 1988–2024. It reveals the global presence and over-representation of US studies in ARTs research. Journals in education policy and teacher education publish that research strongly. Topical foci of ARTs research include teacher education, policy reform, Teach For America, teacher certification, and student achievement-cum-teacher retention. Early ARTs research challenged traditional teacher certification, using student achievement to query the effectiveness of traditional and alternative teacher education. Alongside neoliberal reform, ARTs research then highlighted accountability in the name of equity. Future research directions are discussed. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Autonomous vehicles (AVs) should prioritise pedestrian safety in a traffic accident. External human–machine interfaces (eHMIs), which enhance communication through visual and auditory signals, become essential as AVs become prevalent. This study aimed to investigate the current state of research on eHMIs, with a specific focus on pedestrian interactions with eHMI-equipped AVs. A bibliometric analysis of 234 papers published between January 2014 and December 2023 was conducted using the Web of Science database. The analysis revealed a remarkable increase in eHMI research since 2018, with the principal research topics on crossing behaviour and eHMI evaluations of pedestrians. Subsequently, 38 articles were selected for a systematic review. The systematic review, conducted through a detailed examination of each selected article, showed that pedestrian crossing behaviour is usually measured using crossing initiation time, response time, walking speed and eye tracking data. The eHMI evaluations of pedestrians were made through questionnaires that measure clarity, preference and acceptance. Research findings showed that pedestrians’ crossing behaviour and eHMI evaluations are influenced by human factors (age and nationality), vehicle factors (eHMI type, eHMI colour and eHMI position) and environmental factors (signalisation and distractions). The results also revealed that current eHMI experiments often use virtual reality and video methodologies, which do not fully replicate the complexities of real-world environments. Additionally, the exploration regarding the impact of human factors, such as gender and familiarity with AVs, on pedestrian crossing behaviour is lacking. Furthermore, the investigation of multimodal eHMI systems is limited. This review highlighted the importance of standardising eHMI design, and the key gaps in the current eHMI research were revealed. These insights will guide future research towards effective eHMI solutions through informed theoretical studies and practical applications in autonomous driving. © 2024

AB  - Immersive virtual reality (IVR) simulates real-world construction scenarios in remote environments, providing construction management students with interactive hands-on learning experiences. However, in-depth exploration and synthesis of recent advancements in IVR technology tailored explicitly for construction management students’ learning is lacking. To fill this gap, this study reviewed existing publications on IVR technology practices in the last decade (2014–2024) using a mixed quantitative-qualitative review method. Precisely, 287 related articles were identified through keyword searching on Scopus and then fed into VOSviewer bibliometric analysis and visualization software to map recent trends. Furthermore, a qualitative discussion highlights the cutting-edge IVR technologies for construction management students’ learning across three dimensions: (1) biometric feedback integration, (2) multisensory system, and (3) IVR for soft skills development. Additionally, three areas that require further investigation beyond the current advancements in IVR for construction management education were proposed: (1) student data privacy and security, (2) student safety in multisensory systems, and (3) assessment of students’ acquired soft skills. This study provides valuable insights into the evolving domain of educational technology, informing students, educators, researchers, and practitioners about the effectiveness of IVR in enhancing construction management learning experiences and outcomes. Furthermore, this study highlights innovative aspects of IVR technology for construction management education that require further research. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The utilization of various multi-criteria decision-making methods has spread in the field of transportation, which presents challenge when identifying the most relevant research topics and applied methods. This paper uses the combination of two advanced review methodologies, the bibliometric review approach and the systematic review approach, to investigate how the well-known analytic hierarchy process (AHP) has been used to support transportation-related decisions in the last two decades. A total of 2659 scientific documents are screened, and the keywords are identified by the bibliometric analysis, while the systematic review analyzes 108 relevant publications based on the keywords identified by the bibliometric analysis. According to the results, the sub-themes of transportation infrastructure, location selection, and accident prevention are the most important topics along with the environmental impacts of transportation. Considering the methodologies, the fuzzy-AHP, the TOPSIS, and the Delphi techniques are usually applied with AHP as hybrid models. The systematic review sheds light on the capability of the AHP method to identify the safety factors of different transport modes, the possibility of handling quantitative and qualitative criteria in location selection, and the potential to gain a trustworthy choice among transportation infrastructure development alternatives. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - This research explores the development of fine arts learning media using interactive multimedia research. The goal can be a reference for researchers in conducting and defining research themes, especially around multimedia learning. The method is used through a bibliographic approach with computational mapping analysis using VOSviewer. Article data is retrieved from the Google Scholar database using a publish-or-perish reference management application. Article titles and abstracts serve as guidelines when searching for keywords like "art," "learning media," and "multimedia." We found 447 seemingly related articles. The study period used as learning material is a paper from the last five years (2018 to 2023) indexed by Google Scholar. The results of research on fine arts learning media using interactive multimedia can be classified into four terms. The first term "Training" belongs to cluster 2 with a total of 34 links, an overall link strength of 138, and 59 events. The second term, "Media", belongs to cluster 2, with a total of 30 links, an overall connection strength of 142, and 74 events. The third term, "Multimedia", belongs to cluster 2, with a total of 27 links, an overall connection strength of 110, and 55 events. The fourth term "art" belongs to cluster 1 with a total of 34 links, an overall link strength of 138 and 59 events. From 2018 to 2020, the survey found research fluctuations in several media-based art learning media studies (65, 110, and 124 publications per year, respectively). The number of studies decreased from 44 (2021) to 16 (2023) from 2021 to 2023. Thus, there are still many opportunities for researchers to discuss it. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

AB  - Mangroves in the Western Indian Ocean face increasing threats from climate change such as rising sea levels and storm surges. To increase mangrove resilience in the region, there is a need to leverage technological innovations for research, management and monitoring purposes. The aim of this paper was thus to review the role of technology in supporting mangrove research regionally. A bibliometric analysis was conducted using Google Scholar for the period 2004–2024. From 31, 934 articles retrieved, 160 records were selected for the assessment and keyword co-occurrence was conducted on VosViewer. Remote sensing, GIS and modeling techniques were highlighted as key tools for monitoring mangrove health, extent and change over time. Community engagement through participatory strategies such as PGIS was noted as effective mangrove conservation and resilience building efforts. The keyword co-occurrence analysis showed that there was a strong link between mangrove, climate change and sea level rise suggesting the importance of mangroves in coastal resilience. By embracing advancements in technology and fostering collaboration between researchers, local communities and practitioners, coastal nations’ resilience to climate change impacts can be enhanced by better managing and monitoring mangroves. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Geometry and graphics is the core element of brand logo, which determines the visual presentation and symbolic meaning of brand logo. Current studies in China have achieved rich results on brand logo graphics. However, there is a lack of research reviews on brand logo graphics in existing research results. Therefore, this paper adopts a quantitative method through bibliometric analysis, to analyze research status and future development trends in logo graphics of Chinese brand, which selects the journal articles of CNKI research on ``brand logo graphics" and uses CiteSpace visual bibliometric software for comprehensive analysis. The results show that the research hotspots of Chinese brand logo graphics mainly focus on the application of geometry and graphics in brand logo design, the impact of brand logo graphics on brand visual image, and research on the application of brand logo geometry. Combining macro influencing factors and graph analysis, the research trend in this field will focus on innovative graphic design. Future research should focus on the impact of new culture and technology on brand logo graphic design. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Hericium mushrooms are a group of rare medicinal mushrooms that have attracted considerable attention worldwide. In order to gain insight into the current trends and frontiers of Hericium research, we conducted a comprehensive search of the Web of Science (WOS) database to identify relevant literature on Hericium research. Following an optimised search strategy and careful removal of duplicate entries, a total of 839 documents were selected from the core WOS database for bibliometric analysis. We used VOSviewer to visualize the co-occurrence network between publishing organizations, while CiteSpace allowed us to visualize and analyse the national co-occurrence network, author co-occurrence network, keyword co-linearity, keyword clustering and co-citation mapping. Our analysis revealed a significant and continuous increase in the number of publications related to Hericium mushrooms, with a peak observed in 2021. Examination of publication statistics by country (region) and institution identified China and Universiti Malaysia as the leading contributors in their respective fields, with active collaboration with other countries and institutions. The analysis of author co-occurrence suggests that inter-author communications and collaborations may be geographically limited by the research institutions to which they belong. Various keyword-based analyses highlighted the structural diversity and bioactivities of small molecule compounds derived from Hericium mushrooms, underscoring their potential health-protective effects as rare food and medicinal mushrooms. Through co-citation analysis, we identified J. Agr. Food Chem. as the most cited journal for Hericium mushroom research results, while Yoko Kawagishi of Shizuoka University (Japan) emerged as the most cited researcher in the field. Overall, our findings suggest that research into the potential anti-neurodegenerative properties of Hericium mushrooms is a promising area of investigation, with a focus on elucidating the underlying mechanisms of action. © 2024

AB  - The literature on dynamic managerial capabilities (DMCs) has grown considerably and has evolved over the past two decades. Helfat and Martin (2015) reviewed this literature, which helped clarify the nomological network surrounding DMCs while synthesizing the empirical literature related to its impact on strategic change and firm performance. In this paper, we build on their work by applying bibliometric techniques to trace the evolution of this multidisciplinary construct. The analysis of 33 key journals and 188 articles spanning more than three decades (1989–2023) comprises distinct time periods and longitudinal trends that support meaningful visual representations of the bibliographic data. The findings reveal seven foundational themes for DMC research: upper echelons, cognitive biases, cognitive strategic groups, capability configurations, issue interpretation, individual & group characteristics, and market & network orientation. We also extend the DMC framework of Helfat & Martin (2015) by including political capital as the fourth underpinning. On the basis of the temporal and topic trend analysis, we conclude with recommendations for further research avenues that can shed light on the future of DMC literature. We also highlight practical implications for practicing managers and firms to strengthen competitive differentiation by building and leveraging DMCs. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Machine learning and deep learning are currently widely used in various fields, including remote sensing for food security. However, there is no research that specifically examines the interests, developments, and trends of this research in the future. This study aims to examine the development of machine and deep learning research for mapping food crops through a bibliometric approach with computational mapping analysis using VOSviewer. Article data was obtained from the Google Scholar database using the publish or perish reference manager application. The title and abstract of the article were used to guide the search process by referring to the keyword “Machine and Deep Learning Mapping Food Crops”. 114 relevant articles were discovered. Google Scholar-indexed articles over the last ten years, from 2014 to 2023, were used as study material. The results show that machine research and deep learning for mapping food crops can be separated into three terms: machine learning, deep learning, and plant mapping. The term “Crop Mapping” has 57 links for a total of 199 links. The term "machine learning" has 41 links for a total of 79 links, and the term "deep learning" has 26 links for a total of 41 links. The results of the analysis of machine development and deep learning publications for mapping food crops in the last 10 years show a constant increase. The peak of the increase occurred in 2021 and 2022, namely 25 articles published per year, respectively. This means that this research topic is still relatively new in terms of interest and exploration, therefore there is still room further research. We examine numerous articles that have been published on machine and deep learning for crop mapping and their relation to the field studied with VOSviewer. This review can serve as a starting point for further research in different domains. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Seawater desalination (SWD) can partially mitigate the increasing freshwater needs globally. Although, SWD is multifaceted and involves processes with environmental and economic challenges, research is often analyzed through Literature Reviews (LRs) in specific contexts that may miss general trends. Bibliometric Analyzes (BAs), however, provide researchers with an overview through Co-occurrence Networks (CNs), Strategic Diagrams (SDs), Thematic Subnetworks (TSs), and Thematic Evolution Diagrams (TEDs). Nevertheless, their use in SWD research has been limited, with minimal attention given to them. Thus, we created a bibliometric dataset, compared it with other BAs, and developed CNs, SDs, TSs, and a TED for SWD. Furthermore, key term searches (Energy, Solar, Reverse Osmosis, Modeling and Optimization, Membrane Distillation, Environmental, Economics, Fouling, Nanofiltration, and Ultrafiltration) and their literature are discussed. Geographical analysis shows China and the US lead SWD research, shifting from process design to membrane fabrication and solar energy. Furthermore, RO remains the leading technique despite high energy demands. Solar desalination shows promise but faces cost and scalability challenges. Environmental and economic concerns are discussed, as well as emerging solutions regarding, solar desalination, blue energy, “blue carbon”, and zero liquid discharge. Research gaps include fouling effects and pretreatment incorporation in optimizations are also highlighted. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Climate change and related issues such as water scarcity and the urgent need for a transition to sustainable energy sources have motivated the development of novel processes and techniques that can be applied for water treatment, recovery and reuse. Among these emerging processes, membrane distillation in its different configurations has been extensively studied and reported in the literature. A bibliometric analysis was performed to investigate the research documents published in the scientific database Scopus until 2024, related to use of membrane distillation for water recovery and reuse. The main quantitative attributes of the research during this period were identified. The results of this analysis showed a very low scientific production until 2005, followed by a rapid exponential increase since then. The combined contribution of the two most productive countries (China and USA respectively) accounted for more than 41 % of the total number of publications, followed by Australia and Saudi Arabia, which occupied the third and fourth positions in the ranking. Chemical engineering was the most important subject category (57.4 % contribution), closely followed by environmental sciences. The review of the most cited documents and keywords showed that membrane wetting is one of the main drawbacks that can reduce the performance of membrane distillation and the use of innovative superhydrophobic, omniphobic or Janus membranes resulted an adequate solution to avoid this problem. Moreover, the desalination of seawater, brines and other highly saline solutions can be considered as the most studied application of membrane distillation. The consideration of the energetic aspects of membrane distillation and its coupling with other technologies were identified as relevant topics during the bibliometric network analysis. Special attention was given to the potential of membrane distillation for water recovery and reuse in the Chilean context of water stress for the production of drinking water and the treatment of domestic greywater and wastewater from mining and other industrial activities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Since polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are on the list of regulated chemicals, novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) have been produced as alternatives and extensively used since the end of the 19th century. A comprehensive assessment of the environmental burden of NBFRs, which are emerging contaminants with bio-toxic and carcinogenic properties, is urgently needed. Given that soil is a major sink for organic pollutants, this study systematically reviewed global data on NBFRs in soil for the period of 1990–2024 via a bibliometric analysis of 70 publications from the Web of Science Core Collection, reaching the following achievements. (1) NBFRs in soils have been reported in 17 countries or regions worldwide, ranging from not detected to 8.46 × 104 ng/g dw, showing an increasing trend over time, with severe contamination in Asia and Australia. (2) NBFR concentrations varied significantly across land use types: manufacturing land > electronic waste disposal areas > urban soil > farmland > forest > remote areas. (3) NBFRs with log KOA > 10 tend to settle from the air into the soil, where they may be absorbed by plant roots and bioaccumulate in the food chain. (4) Organism dietary habits and metabolism, along with the hydrophobicity and molecular weight of NBFRs, contribute to bioaccumulation differences. (5) Successive reductive debromination is the primary degradation pathway for NBFRs, and microorganisms such as the white-rot fungus P. ostreatus show potential for remediating NBFR-contaminated soil. This review clarifies the pollution status of soil NBFRs and provides a solid reference to develop management policies. Future research should focus on studying the transport mechanisms of NBFRs between soil and other media, and assessing the cumulative effects of high trophic level organisms on NBFRs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - It is unknown to what extent leading researchers are currently involved in the leadership of leading research universities as presidents or as executive board members. The academic administrative leader (president or equivalent role) of each of the 146 Carnegie tier 1 USA universities and of any of the top-100 universities per Times Higher Education (THE) 2024 ranking and the members of the executive governing bodies (Board of Trustees, Council, Corporation or similar) for the each of the top-20 universities per THE 2024 ranking were examined for high citation impact in their scientific subfield. Highly-cited was defined as the top-2 % of a composite citation indicator (that considers citations, h-index, co-authorship adjusted hm-index and citations to papers as single, first, last authors) in their main scientific subfield based on career-long impact until end-2022 among all scholars focusing in the same subfield and having published ≥5 full papers. Very highly-cited was similarly defined as the top-0.2 %. Science was divided into 174 fields per Science-Metrix classification. 38/146 (26 %) tier 1 USA university leaders as of end-2023 were highly-cited and 5/146 (3 %) were very highly-cited. The respective figures for the top-100 THE 2024 universities globally were 43/100 and 12/100. For the 13 US universities among the top-20 of THE 2024, the probability of their leader being highly-cited was lower (6/13, 46 %) than the probability of a randomly chosen active full tenured professor from their faculty being highly-cited (52–77 %). Across 444 board members of 14 top-10 THE 2024 universities with data, only 65 (15 %) were academics, and 19 (4 %) were highly-cited; academics were rare in USA university boards. Board members had predominantly careers in for-profit companies. In conclusion, leading research universities have a dearth of leaders who are high-impact researchers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To achieve carbon neutrality, the collaborative involvement of various entities, such as nations, regions, and industries plays a crucial role. As a valuable tool to undertake macro-level research on carbon emissions, input-output analysis can provide insights and references to formulate effective policies and measures for carbon reduction. Therefore, 1156 carbon emission studies based on the input-output method were critically reviewed in this study. Meanwhile, the bibliometric method was employed to analyze the number of studies, academic influence and collaborative networks of countries, institutions and journals, as well as cluster analysis of keywords. The findings show a significant increase in the number of papers in this field, China, the USA, and the UK emerged as the most influential countries in this field. Apart from quantitative analysis, this study incorporates a qualitative analysis of the literature from the perspectives of research objects and research methods. It is observed that, carbon footprint inequality and embodied carbon transfer of trade receive a lot of attention. In addition, and there are still gaps remain in the research of carbon emission at city level and emerging industries. There is an urgent need to improve the comprehensiveness and refinement of carbon emission related research based on IO model. This paper proposes future research directions in data, topics, methods and application of research results. This helps to explore future research agenda, to formulate carbon emission reduction policies, and to promote the global carbon neutrality process. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background and aims: We provide an overview and data visualization trends of orthopaedic research published by the Journal of Orthopedics (JOO) from 2013 to 2024. Methods: We used Scopus database to retrieve all articles published by the JOO from 2013 to 2024, as of 15.7.2024. Bibliometric analysis and visualization of the global orthopaedic literature were performed using Microsoft Excel and VOSviewer software to explore the research hotspots in this field in the past 12 years. Results: The 2074 publications covered in the JOO published between 2013 and 2024 were identified. The annual average and six-year cumulative publications depicted growth rates of 36.23 % and 147.99 %, respectively. Of the 80 global publications, the main participating countries were from Europe (n = 26), and Asia (n = 13). North America (37.37 %), Europe (34.89 %) and Asia (30.42 %) contributed a significant share of journal output. The most contributing countries were the USA, followed by the U.K., India, and Japan. The visualization and analysis of topical research trends reveal that the JOO covers almost the entire spectrum of orthopaedic research, with the most focus on the Knee (26.38 %), Hip (21.53 %), Shoulder (8.79 %) and Spine (7.09 %) and its subfields, such as arthroplasty (882 papers), surgery (192 papers), radiography (177 papers), osteoarthritis (166), pain (135 papers), fractures (133) and arthroscopy (70). The 68 (3.32 %) of the 2047 publications received 30 and above citations and together received 3466 citations, constituting 51.73 % share of total citations. The Hospital for Special Surgery (USA), and Singapore General Hospital were the most productive organizations, while the most impactful organizations were the University of Toledo Medical Center (USA), and Università degli Studi di Messina (Italy). The most productive authors were R. Vaishya (India), and J.A. Dubin (USA), whereas V. Filardi (Italy) and J.M. Newman (USA) were the most impactful authors of the JOO. Conclusion: The JOO is a destination for global orthopaedic research. It has progressively received an increasing number of manuscripts and depicted high annual average publication growth rates, besides witnessing an increase in the significant number of citations received. It has helped to improve the journal's ranking, impact and reputation. © 2024 Professor P K Surendran Memorial Education Foundation

AB  - With the advent of numerous reports related to health and environmental hazards associated with microplastics (MPs), scientists have been engrossed in developing sustainable technologies for MP mitigation. Conventional methods for the remediation of MPs have several limitations, but with the increasing demand for biological mitigation methods, the latest technologies are prioritized. Among biological-driven methods, phytoremediation and phycoremediation are the two peaking approaches that have gained momentum because of their eco-friendliness, cost-effectiveness, and recyclability options. Investigations of the mechanisms underlying phytoremediation and phycoremediation processes can provide possible insights into practical applications in the present scenario. Modern instrumentation is a prerequisite for identifying and characterizing MPs and quantifying their removal efficiency. The current investigation highlights a unique combination of elaborate discussions on the use of plants in the mitigation of MPs, bibliometric analysis of the current status of research, their relevance to the modern context, and the development of a combinatorial strategy to amalgamate the advantages of these two unique processes via the concept of constructed wetlands for synergistically mitigating MPs. Thus, this review provides fresh insights into addressing MP pollution with sustainable ideologies to achieve improved mitigation outcomes without compromising the balance of the ecosystem. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Major sudden disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, and fires, often cause significant casualties. Emergency evacuation is crucial in mitigating these impacts. Different types of disaster incidents vary significantly in terms of impact scope, suddenness, and urgency. Each type of disaster possesses distinct characteristics, necessitating varying requirements for emergency evacuation. Consequently, we conducted a bibliometric analysis and visual mapping of evacuation processes in major natural disasters from 2004-2023, analyzing 7213 publications from the Web of Science database via VOSviewer and ArcGIS. Our study identified three developmental phases: an initial phase (pre-2011) with 1169 publications, a growth phase (2012-2018) with 2772 publications, and an expansion phase (post-2019) with 3335 publications. This study provides a comprehensive review and classification of emergency evacuation theories and methods in major disaster scenarios. It emphasizes the necessity of assessing the scope and intensity of different types of major emergent disasters, defining and simulating the affected behaviors of the influenced populations, and formulating differentiated emergency evacuation strategies accordingly. Keyword analysis reveals two main trends supporting these findings: an increasing focus on complex evacuation modeling and simulation techniques, manifested in the application of various simulation-optimized microscopic and macroscopic models such as cellular automata, social force models, agent-based models, pedestrian flow, and network flow models, enhancing disaster understanding and prediction capabilities; and the strategic development of tailored evacuation strategies for specific disaster contexts, thereby improving disaster response efficiency. Three key future pathways for safety evacuation research are outlined: refining evacuation behavior models for greater accuracy, improving the coordination of complex, multi-level evacuation procedures, and integrating indoor and outdoor evacuation strategies more seamlessly. It establishes a forward-looking framework for advancing safety evacuation studies in major emergencies. © 2024

AB  - In "low-cost" solutions, ensuring economic accessibility and democratizing the availability of emerging technologies stand as pivotal considerations. This study undertakes a systematic literature review of low-cost 3D mapping solutions. Leveraging SCOPUS as the primary database, a comprehensive bibliometric analysis encompassing 1380 publications was conducted, subsequently narrowing the focus to 87 recent publications for detailed review. This research endeavors to delineate the defining characteristics of low-cost systems, elucidate their principal applications and preferred platforms, assess accessibility level, gauge the extent of innovation in both hardware and software development, explore the contributions of Deep Learning and data fusion, evaluate the consideration of data quality, and examine the contemporary relevance of photogrammetry within low-cost context. The findings demonstrate that many authors subjectively use the term low-cost to highlight qualities of a technology, methodology or sensor, but challenges arise from data quality comparisons with high-cost systems. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Empathy for pain encompasses the processes of perceiving, understanding, and responding to the pain of others, playing a crucial role in social interaction and individual development. The increasing interest in this field has led to a surge in related publications; however, the overall quantity and quality of these works remain uncertain. To address this issue, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of research on empathy for pain. Our study meticulously examined 479 publications to provide a comprehensive analysis of bibliographic elements such as annual publication trends, authorship, country of origin, institutional affiliations, journals, and keywords. Our findings indicate that, although there has been a rise in research on empathy for pain in recent years, the volume remains insufficient and is predominantly concentrated in a few countries, authors, and institutions. Additionally, current research mainly focuses on four primary areas: perception, pain, empathy, and emotion. We assert that future research will likely explore the relationship between EEG measurements and empathy for pain to determine if such measurements can effectively quantify empathy, thereby enhancing clinical management. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Communication among project team members is an indispensable requirement to provide momentum toward achieving efficiency, time, cost, quality, and safety targets in construction projects. Therefore, investigating the main patterns influencing communication in construction projects sheds light on hidden knowledge that can help improve project performance. This study aims to develop a framework that explains communication elements in construction projects with key communication constructs. To achieve the study objective, systematic literature review, bibliometric analysis, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to probe the impact of each construct on communication and examine the importance level of the items. The model was developed based on five constructs (i.e., trust, attitude toward knowledge sharing, collaboration, reciprocal feedback, and social ties) comprising 26 items. Findings indicate that collaboration and trust are the most critical constructs, while the level of frequency in information exchange and consistent behavior of team members are the most vital items reflecting these constructs, respectively. The outcomes of this study are expected to enhance interpersonal communication abilities by considering the key indicators of communication patterns in construction projects. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Introduction: The objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) has positioned itself as a key tool to assess skills optimally and reliably. This study sought to analyze the trends and profile of the scientific production on its use in health sciences. Materials and methods: A descriptive and cross-sectional study was carried out on bibliometric data. We included 844 articles on OSCE published in journals indexed in Scopus between 2018 and 2022. A descriptive and cross-sectional analysis was performed to bibliometric data with the Scival tool. Results: The number of publications has increased from 2018 to 2022, most of these are in high impact scientific journals. Most articles had national collaboration (42.4%) and international collaboration presented more citations per publication (6.5). The institution with the highest scientific activity was Harvard University, in addition to being the one with the highest impact. The journals Currents in Pharmacy Teaching and Learning and Medical Science Educator have more publications, but the Journal of Educational Evaluation for Health Professions (1,744) has a higher normalized impact. Zabar Sondra leads in scientific output, but MacArio Alex (0.91) has a higher weighted impact. Conclusions: Research has increased, mainly in scientific journals of greater prestige and impact, and with more frequent national collaboration; in addition, there is greater participation of authors and institutions from North America. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze the trends in ruminant products research (beef, goat, lamb, and milk) research, particularly conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) using intellectual and conceptual structures in bibliometric analysis. This study was conducted due to limited bibliometric articles despite the ongoing interest in the field. Data was extracted from the Scopus database and visualized using VOSviewer and the bibliometrix R package. The analysis was conducted on 2725 articles published between 2014-2024. The results indicate a decrease in the annual growth of publication in CLA research on ruminant products. Despite this decline, certain key journals persist in their role as primary references for CLA in ruminant products. The analysis revealed predominant topics such as fatty acids, meat quality, and biohydrogenation. However, certain emerging topics, including the application of particular feedstuffs and feed additives to boost fatty acids and CLA levels, have not been thoroughly investigated. © 2025 Author (s).

AB  - This study examines Malaysia's poverty rate with respect to SDG poverty reduction targets, the specific policies and programmes implemented to address poverty within the SDGs' framework, and the challenges and obstacles faced by Malaysia in achieving SDG poverty reduction targets. Despite Malaysia's significant achievements in reducing the aggregate poverty rate from 8.9% in 1995 to 1.7% in 2012, the country still faces poverty pockets in rural areas, specific states or regions, ethnic groups, and urban areas. These figures underscore the importance of targeted spatial planning and policy implementation to eradicate poverty effectively. Utilising a bibliometric analysis of the SCOPUS database, this study identifies key indicators of poverty in Malaysia based on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Furthermore, Malaysia's alignment with SDG Poverty Reduction Targets comprises its poverty eradication programme, which has successfully reduced the incidence of poverty from 49.3% in 1970 to 8.7% in 1995 and then to 0.4% in 2016. Despite this overall reduction in poverty, the reality of relative poverty and the poverty gap is increasing, indicating the need for a more comprehensive approach to address poverty and inequality. The Malaysian government has prioritised the provision of employment opportunities, household income, infrastructure, and facilities. However, challenges remain in identifying the infrastructure and facilities capable of providing maximum services for all levels of society, particularly in rural areas. The bibliometric analysis highlights the expanding sphere of SDG poverty reduction research in Malaysia, which reflects the country's intricate socio-economic landscape, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasing academic output and impressive citation metrics indicate a strong scholarly interest in addressing poverty through various approaches. However, the emerging nature of this field warrants further exploration of the socio-legal and political factors that impact poverty alleviation. By focusing on the local context and incorporating grey literature into research, discussions can be enhanced, enriching the applicability of poverty reduction strategies and contributing to global sustainable development discourses. © 2025, Malque Publishing.

AB  - Introduction: Disinformation is a critical challenge for social understanding and democracies, which has driven initiatives to address its causes and solutions. Methodology: Media disinformation, as a critical challenge, has driven a bibliometric analysis of 41 postgraduate theses from Peruvian universities. Through conceptual mapping, key concepts, categories, and relationships were identified. Results: Peruvian university theses highlight that media disinformation, especially in the digital realm and during the pandemic, is a complex phenomenon that affects public perception and trust in the media. They emphasize the need for a comprehensive approach that includes media literacy and regulations to tackle informational manipulation and strengthen social resilience. Discussions: Media disinformation, intensified in the digital age, has distorted reality and undermined democratic values, leading to polarization, radicalization, and distrust in the media, which has driven governmental actions and studies to address this challenge. Conclusions: The theses have broken down disinformation, making the problem more visible and allowing for the development of effective solutions and policies for its mitigation. © 2025, HISIN (History of Information Systems).

AB  - The construction of effective ecological security patterns is crucial for sustaining ecosystem health and preserving the functionality of ecological services. This approach is vital for improving human well-being and protecting ecological security. This study employs bibliometric analysis to examine the topic of ecological security pattern construction, with a systematic review of 823 articles published from 2000 to 2024, analyzed from quantitative and visual angles. The analysis uncovers research progress, identifies hotspots, and outlines key themes. The findings show that China has a substantial lead in publication numbers (77.02%), with Europe dominating in terms of average citations per paper. The United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany are leaders in international collaboration, with over 50% of their publications being collaborative efforts. The primary outlets for these publications are top-tier and open-access journals, with Ecological Indicators topping both the publication count and citation frequency. The study's main themes encompass ecological security, ecosystem services, conservation planning, urban growth boundaries, ecological corridors, ecological networks, and green infrastructure. The study elucidates research progress and gaps through a closed-loop construction process of ecological security assessment—source identification—corridor extraction—effectiveness evaluation. Finally, the paper proposes three key directions for future ecological security pattern construction: integrity, scale, and dynamism. This study aids researchers in gaining a deeper understanding of the current state of ecological security pattern construction research and provides historical references for future studies. © 2024

AB  - Applied Linguistics (AL) research has undergone significant transformation in recent decades, accompanied by a surge in secondary research within the field. Using WoS data, we conducted an extensive bibliometric analysis of 881 secondary research articles and 44,752 references spanning 1970 to 2022. Utilizing CiteSpace's “author co-citation network,” “keyword co-occurrence network,” and “burst detection” analyses, we identified core research clusters, their key topics, connections, and significant bursts. Then we synthesize all the main clusters' content through in-depth analysis. Our findings reveal the growing popularity of secondary research in AL, with substantial contributions from Asian countries despite Anglo-American dominance. Key disciplines influencing the AL's intellectual structure include Psychology, Neurology, Sociology, Education, and Computer Science. Four thematic strands anchor AL's conceptual structure: Language Education & Computer Science, Psycholinguistics, Neurolinguistics, and Sociolinguistics. The top-ranked co-cited authors by burst strength are Moher, Chomsky, and Botting. Using a data-driven theory of scientific revolution, we identify emerging research trends and track dynamic changes from an epistemic perspective. This dynamic perspective contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the evolution of the AL domain, signaling a new era of Critical Applied Linguistics. This study, an empirically-based overview of AL secondary research, offers important implications for future research. © 2024

AB  - Background: There is a significant global demand for precise diagnosis and effective treatment of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), with innate immunity, particularly the complement system, exerting a profound influence on its pathogenesis. Additionally, the gut-kidney axis pathway is vital in the emergence and development of IgAN. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search in the Web of Science database, spanning from January 1, 2000 to December 18, 2023. The gathered literature underwent a visual examination through CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Scimago Graphica to delve into authors, nations, organizations, key terms, and other pertinent elements. Result: Between 2000 and 2023, a total of 720 publications were identified, out of which 436 publications underwent screening for highly relevant literature analysis. The average annual number of articles focusing on IgAN, innate immunity, and the gut-kidney axis is approximately 31, with an upward trend observed. In terms of research impact encompassing publication count and authorship, the United States emerged as the leading contributor. Prominent keywords included “complement”, “activation”, “microbe”, “gut-kidney axis”, “C4d deposition”, “alternative pathway” and “B cells” along with other prospective hot topics. Conclusion: The correlation between IgAN and innate immunity is a focal point in current scientific research. Recent literature underscores the significance of the gut-kidney axis, where intestinal microorganisms and metabolites may influence IgAN. The complement system, a key component of innate immunity, also has a crucial function.Advancements in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment hinge on unraveling this intricate relationship. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Trust plays a crucial role in the success and adoption of Named Data Networking (NDN), a data-centric communication paradigm. This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of research articles related to trust in NDN, aiming to provide insights into the current state of this research. Based on the conducted analysis, it was discovered that a total of 106 research papers pertaining to trust in NDN were published within the period of 2017 to 2023, as documented in the Scopus database. To better understand the present state of trust in NDN research and where the field is headed, four questions were formulated based on this topic. Several tools have been used in this study, including Microsoft Excel, OpenRefine, VOSviewer, Biblioshiny and Harzing’s Publish or Perish. The observed trend indicates a notable increase in the quantity of articles published in the NDN journal during the periods spanning from 2017 to 2018, as well as from 2021 to 2022. The analysis revealed that China emerged as the nation with the highest number of published works, closely trailed by the United States. We expect many more regions to explore NDN in the future, and as a result, our collective understanding of the Internet's path will grow. This bibliometric analysis serves as a valuable resource for researchers, providing an overview of the current state of trust research in NDN and guiding future investigations in this evolving field. © 2025, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, with the rapid development of biomedicine, the study of brain aging and exosomes has attracted more and more attention, but there is no bibliometrics analysis in this field. OBJECTIVE: To objectively analyze domestic and foreign literature on brain aging and exosomes in the past 15 years, to summarize the research status, hot spots, and development trends in this field. METHODS: Using the core database of Web of Science as a search platform, we downloaded the literature on brain aging and exosomes published from the establishment of the database to December 28, 2022, and analyzed the data from the aspects of country or region, institution, author, keywords, and co-cited literature using CiteSpace 6.1.R6 visualization software. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A total of 1 045 research articles were included, and the number of publications on brain aging and exosomes research both domestically and internationally was showing an increasing trend year by year. The United States ranked first with 429 papers, and China ranked second with 277 papers. Louisiana State University ranked first with 16 articles. Professor Lukiw Walter J from Louisiana State University in the United States was the author with the highest number of publications, and Professor Bartel DP from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was the author with the most citations. The most prolific Journal was the International Journal of Molecular Sciences. Alzheimer’s disease, microRNA, gene expression, extracellular vesicles, exosomes, oxidative stress, and biomarkers are the most relevant terms. According to the research on hot topics, biomarkers have become a new research hotspot. The above results indicate that the research on brain aging and exosomes has gradually increased in the past 15 years. The research direction has gradually shifted from the initial exploration of the expression of miRNAs in central nervous system diseases related to brain aging to the search for biomarkers that can identify and diagnose neurodegenerative diseases. The study of exocrine miRNAs to protect central nervous system from damage has emerged as promising therapeutic strategy. © 2025, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

AB  - Background and aims: As global demographics shift toward an older population, cognitive impairment is becoming increasingly critical. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), an innovative brain stimulation technique, has the potential to significantly improve cognitive function. Our main aim is to comprehensively analyze the existing literature, identify key aspects of tDCS research in the rehabilitation of cognitive impairment, and predict future trends in this field. Methods: We used the Web of Science (WOS) database to search for English articles and reviews relevant to this topic. For visual analysis of the literature, we employed the WOS analysis tool, CiteSpace, along with VOSviewer software to ensure comprehensive analysis. Results: We included 2940 articles published between 1998 and 2023. Over 25 years, annual publications and citations in this field increased steadily, peaking at 379 articles in 2021. Michael A. Nitsche was a major contributor. Most articles came from developed countries, primarily North America and Europe, and journals generally had modest impact factors. Research in this field primarily aims to treat cognitive impairment resulting from pathological aging or neuropsychiatric disorders, with a particular focus on specific brain regions. Recently, researchers have integrated various treatment modalities with tDCS techniques to actively investigate effective strategies to mitigate cognitive impairments associated with pathological aging. Conclusion: This study presents the first bibliometric analysis of the literature on tDCS in the rehabilitation of cognitive impairment, highlighting key areas of research and emerging trends. These findings provide critical insights for future tDCS interventions targeting cognitive impairment associated with pathological aging. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Research suggests that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) holds promise in offering innovative approaches to tackle neurodegenerative disorders. In our endeavor, we conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis to delve into the landscape of TCM research within the realm of neurodegenerative diseases, aiming to uncover the present scenario, breadth, and trends in this field. This analysis presents potentially valuable insights for the clinical application of traditional Chinese medicine and provides compelling evidence supporting its efficacy in the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions. Aim of the study: The incidence of neurodegenerative diseases is on the rise, yet effective treatments are still lacking. Research indicates that TCM could offer novel perspectives for addressing neurodegenerative conditions. Nonetheless, the literature on this topic is intricate and multifaceted, with existing reviews offering only limited coverage. To gain a thorough understanding of TCM research in neurodegenerative diseases, we undertook a bibliometric analysis to explore the current status, scope, and trends in this area. Materials and methods: A literature search was carried out on April 1, 2024, utilizing the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). Visualization and quantitative analyses were then performed with the assistance of CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and R software. Results: A total of 6856 articles were retrieved in the search. Research on TCM for neurodegenerative diseases commenced in 1989 and has exhibited a notable overall growth since then. Main research contributors include East Asian countries like China, as well as the United States. Through our analysis, we identified 15 highly productive authors, 10 top-tier journals, 13 citation clusters, 11 influential articles, and observed a progression in keyword evolution across 4 distinct categories. In 2020, there was a significant upsurge in the knowledge base, collaboration efforts, and publication output within the field. This field is interdisciplinary: network pharmacology emerges as the cutting-edge paradigm in TCM research, while Alzheimer's disease remains a prominent focus among neurodegenerative conditions due to its evolving etiology. A burst detection analysis unveils that in 2024, the focal points of research convergence between TCM and neurodegenerative diseases lie in two key biological processes or mechanisms: autophagy and microbiota. Conclusions: For the first time, this study quantitatively and visually captures the evolution of TCM in addressing neurodegenerative diseases, showcasing a notable acceleration in recent years. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of interdisciplinary collaboration and the necessity for increased global partnerships. Network pharmacology, leveraging the advancements of the big data era, embraces a holistic and systematic approach as a novel paradigm in exploring traditional Chinese medicine and unraveling their fundamental mechanisms. Three ethnomedical plants—Tianma, Renshen, and Wuweizi—demonstrate the promise of their bioactive compounds in treating neurodegenerative disorders, bolstered by their extensive historical usage for such ailments. Moreover, our intricate analysis of the evolutionary trajectories of key themes such as targets and biomarkers substantially enriches our comprehension of the underlying mechanisms involved. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Vernacular architecture can be defined as unique built-form of a particular region, which is evolved through ages using indigenous construction techniques, locally available materials and with respect to local climate and cultural practices of the community. This paper attempts to present a comprehensive understanding of vernacular architecture using bibliometric analysis. The purpose of this study is to develop a knowledge base about the evolution of research in vernacular architecture globally since last 10 years. This article adopts bibliometric research method to quantify the quality and performance of the existing literature and to visualize the research themes and trends in the field. The study presents a three-stage analysis framework containing retrieval of bibliometric data from Web of Science database, data cleaning and bibliometric analysis using R-Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software. To conduct the bibliometric analysis, the Web of Science database was chosen, considering it the highest and largest scientific database for data retrieval. From the initial search, 8245 documents were found, which were further cleaned and processed for final retrieval on the basis of certain inclusion and exclusion criteria. After screening, a total of 486 documents were used for analysis purpose. The analysis was conducted with respect to documents, journals, citations, authors and their affiliations and countries, collaborations, keywords and thematic areas. The analysis presents a rising trend of research in the field with major emphasis on sustainability, thermal comfort and traditional architecture. It is also found that countries like China, United Kingdom and Spain are the most contributing nations in this area of research with high impact academic publications. However, the collaborative research in the field is significantly less. It is also revealed that climate, management, architecture, design, thermal comfort, behavior, natural ventilation and cultural heritage is much discussed in the past research, whereas the trend is toward efficiency and performance assessment of vernacular buildings. The paper concludes that studies on vernacular architecture are still relevant, and there is still lot to discover and learn from the past. Moreover, the article can be a reference for researchers in the field of vernacular architecture, and further research can be done on the emerging themes in a collaborative manner. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.

AB  - Quality-of-life (QoL) and well-being research in tourism have significantly increased over the past two decades and today presents one of the fastest expanding and inviting areas of research. This study critically examines the QoL and well-being research progress through bibliometric and qualitative thematic analyses. The paper provides a comprehensive overview of the existing perspectives, and conceptual and operational characteristics of this research stream, and further identifies emerging themes and new research directions. While the impact of tourism development on the QoL of residents/communities, tourists, and industry providers is well understood, there is a lack of empirical research focusing on the inclusion and infusion of QoL indicators to measure performance, facilitate tourism policy and governance, and guide destination management. Designing for QoL is discussed as an encompassing approach to destination development that will promote QoL for all stakeholders involved. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Technical and vocational education (TVE) in a country cannot only talk about a narrow scope in the world of education and work but also play a role in ensuring someone achieves a prosperous life socially, economically and environmentally without forgetting preparation for the next generation. This research will visualize and map the development trend of publications on sustainable development in the TVE scope worldwide and in Indonesia. The method used is descriptive quantitative and bibliometric analysis with research data taken from the Scopus database. The results of the study show that increasing research is essential for the development and efforts of the TVE community to increase the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs). Indonesia is recorded as having only started publication in 2017, with a total publication of 42 documents until early 2024. Interestingly, there has been a decline in the number of publications in the last two years. The results of the bibliometric analysis show that research topics in Indonesia have not yet demonstrated success in linking them to the social, economic and environmental spheres. Further research is recommended to conduct a systematic literature review to identify global action program (GAPs) in sustainable development research in TVE communities. © 2025, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During tissue repair and regeneration, macrophages exhibit multiple activities such as promoting inflammation, anti-inflammation, fibrosis, and wound healing at various stages of tissue damage. The heterogeneity and balanced polarization of macrophages are decisive in organ repair. OBJECTIVE: To explore the research hotspots and development trends in the field of macrophage polarization in tissue repair through visualization analysis methods, as well as the research level of global scientific and clinical workers in this field. METHODS: Using bibliometric analysis methods, this study employed Citespace literature visualization analysis software and VOSviewer tools, retrieving related literature from 2013 to 2023 in the Web of Science Core Collection’s Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-Expanded) and Social Sciences Citation Index Expanded (SSCI-Expanded) databases. The analysis results were presented in a dynamic map format, revealing the main trends and focuses of the research. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The number of publications in this field had dramatically increased from 2013 to 2023, with a significant rise starting in 2017. Chinese researchers had the highest number of publications, with 642 papers, while American researchers began focusing on this field early on. Professor Elisseeff Hennifer H had made a substantial contribution to the research in this area. Shanghai Jiao Tong University had produced the most publications. In recent years, keywords such as “hyaluronic acid” and “regulation” had been prevalent. Macrophage polarization research in tissue repair primarily concentrates on its multifunctional regulatory mechanisms, interactions with other cell types, and its behavior under specific pathological conditions. The main research areas include the role of macrophages in wound healing, cardiovascular diseases, chronic inflammation, tumor microenvironments, and regenerative medicine. A deeper understanding of the multifunctionality and polarization mechanisms of macrophages can lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies to enhance tissue repair and regeneration, thereby improving patient treatment outcomes. © 2025, Publishing House of Chinese Journal of Tissue Engineering Research.

AB  - Feed spacers are crucial for enhancing the performance and efficiency of membrane-based technologies. Researchers have long focused on optimizing feed spacer designs and materials to improve fluid mixing and mass/heat transfer across membranes. However, these improvements often increase pressure drops, raising energy requirements. Therefore, innovative designs are sought to balance enhanced mass/heat transfer with reduced pressure drops and improved antifouling properties. This study analyzes patterns and trends in the feed spacer field using bibliometric methods, data analysis, and machine learning. The analysis includes 457 articles from the Scopus database, collected on March 5, 2024, covering publications from 1978 to 2023 across 45 journals. The analysis revealed that reverse osmosis technology emerges as the most studied membrane process, with 153 articles. Furthermore, experimental research in this field is preferred over theoretical evaluations, and the impact of feed spacers on mass transfer and pressure drops is the most explored topic, with 197 articles addressing one or more of these phenomena. Additionally, 204 articles focused on feed spacers’ role in fouling, scaling, and biofouling, with commercial feed spacers being the most frequently studied. The Journal of Membrane Science leads in publication volume with 152 articles, and Vrouwenvelder J.S. is the top author in 4 out of 6 metrics. Sentiment analysis of abstracts shows that authors generally express positive sentiments (385 articles) while maintaining an objective (453 articles) and emotion-free (446 articles) writing style. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The construction industry has long been criticized for low productivity problems. Using off-site construction (OSC) provides an opportunity to improve construction productivity. In terms of OSC adoption, various studies represent the construction projects ranging from entire on-site to complete OSC. Applying design for manufacturing and assembly (DfMA) principles in the building has recently gained industry attention. DfMA as a systematic procedure is expected to be widely adopted in OSC. According to the literature, it can, however, benefit both on-site and OSC activities. This study is based on mixed-method review of 40 selected articles by keywords search of DfMA in OSC and on-site construction. There has been insufficient research comparing these practices more specifically in DfMA in on-site construction. This literature review aims to assess the current state of the DfMA in construction and its adoption in OSC and on-site construction. In order to study the relationship between these practices, a bibliometric analysis was conducted. The contribution to the body of knowledge will be the outcome of this literature review including an in-depth discussion on DfMA in OSC and on-site construction, research gaps, and recommendations for near-future perspectives in this field. The results of this paper can help researchers as well as professionals. It can also guide interested stakeholder groups in implementing DfMA within their projects and reduce the impression that DfMA is only applicable to OSCs. © Canadian Society for Civil Engineering 2025.

AB  - Cerebral toxoplasmosis poses a severe threat to individuals with compromised immune systems. Its ability to reactivate from dormant tissue cysts in the brain underscores its significant global impact on public health and socioeconomic conditions. Therefore, the aim of this study is to perform a research trends analysis using bibliometric and scientific mapping to identify current research trends, prominent researchers, and areas of knowledge that need further exploration. This analysis will provide recommendations for future research directions and clinical practice for cerebral toxoplasmosis in populations undergoing immunosuppressive therapy. Publications were sourced online from the Scopus database on June 1st, 2024. The studies were screened by title and abstract, excluding irrelevant ones. The publication output was then analyzed using the R package's Bibliometrix (Biblioshiny) and VOSviewer. Out of 122 studies, 41 were included. The study highlights significant increases in publications in 2016, 2019, and 2021, each featuring five documents. Collaboration is a notable aspect, averaging 5.3 co-authors per study, with international co-authorships making up 7.3% of the total. The United States is the leading contributing country. Recent trends show a growing focus on diagnosing and clinically examining cerebral toxoplasmosis, managing therapeutic measures, exploring immunological and pathological issues, and addressing the challenges of treating patients with immunosuppressive therapy. In conclusion, this study clarifies the evolving study priorities in cerebral toxoplasmosis among populations using immunosuppressive therapy, highlighting significant trends and identifying key areas for future investigation and development on early detection and the use of prophylaxis. © 2025 by SPC (Sami Publishing Company).

AB  - Background: Tibial tubercle osteotomy (TTO) is a procedure that can be used as an alternative to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or to address patellar instability in patients experiencing dislocation events. The purpose of this paper is to systematically evaluate the most cited articles pertaining to TTO through bibliometric analysis. Methods: A search using the Web of Science database with keywords pertaining to TTO was conducted in April 2024. Articles with the most citations that met all inclusion criteria were analyzed to determine information such as level of evidence (LoE), article topic, journal of publication, year published, country of origin, and institution of origin. Results: The average number of citations was 79 (range of 42–334). The decade with the most publications was from 2010 to 2019 (n = 26; 52%). Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research was the journal with the largest number of published articles (n = 9, 18%). The United States (US) (n = 25; 50%) and France (n = 4; 8%) were the two countries with the most publications. Mayo Clinic (n = 3, 6 %), Ohio State University (n = 3, 6%), and Rush University (n = 3, 6%) were the institutions contributing the most articles. The LoE most reported was level 4 (n = 22; 44%). Topics were primarily related to clinical outcomes (n = 38; 76%). Conclusion: This analysis revealed that most articles were related to clinical outcomes and have been published since 2000. By analyzing the characteristics of the most cited articles, an understanding of current research and identification of areas for further exploration can be determined for TTO.

AB  - Selective catalytic reduction technology with NH3 as reducing agent (NH3-SCR) has been widely applied to remove NOx from stationary sources and diesel vehicles. In this paper, we conducted a bibliometric analysis to understand the research trends in NH3-SCR fields during 1994–2023. The article number was thriving, especially in China. China and USA were the predominant countries with close collaboration relationship. Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tsinghua University and Zhejiang University made greatest contributions, and Politecnico di Milano had strong academic influence. Li, Junhua was prominent author with publishing most articles and mostly cited articles. The stable core author groups had been developed, whose research focuses were identified. Applied Catalysis B: Environment and Energy was the leading journal. The analysis of most frequently cited articles and most frequently used author keywords found six main research domains, including of the low-temperature catalysts, the transition metal modified zeolites, the V-based catalysts, the deactivation and regeneration, the multi-pollutants removal, the aftertreatment system of diesel vehicles and their mechanism studies. Cu-SSZ-13, DFT, the synergistic effect and the simultaneous removal of NOx and other air pollutants got recent attentions. These findings enriched the understandings in NH3-SCR fields, giving some guidelines for the future research. © 2024

AB  - Bitumen emulsion cold mixing (BE-CM) technology is characterized by its environmental friendliness, resource conservation, and ease of construction. It plays a significant leading role in addressing the sustainability challenges in the highway transportation sector and has become a research hotspot in recent years. However, due to the presence of emulsifiers and moisture, the ionic environment of the solution components is complex. Currently, the moisture migration patterns within BE-CM mixtures and its effects on the micro-interface and macro-performance of BE-CM mixtures remain insufficiently understood. This has limited the widespread application of BE-CM technology. To further promote the development of BE-CM technology, this paper, based on bibliometric analysis, reviews and discusses the following three aspects: multi-scale characterization and modeling of moisture effects, adsorption and adhesion behavior at the bitumen emulsion-aggregate interface, and macroscopic performance enhancement of BE-CM mixtures. Additionally, several recommendations are provided to guide future research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Timely and accurate acquisition of field crop growth and environmental information is essential for effective and accurate crop management. Low-altitude unmanned aerial system (UAS) remote sensing technology offers unparalleled advantages in obtaining crop images of different scales making it a vital tool for agricultural information monitoring. Additionally, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have significantly enhanced the efficiency and potential of UAS, especially for agricultural monitoring. This review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis by integrating bibliometric insights and thematic exploration to deepen our understanding of the research landscape and guide future investigations. We check commonly used UAS types and sensors, summarizing the advantages of UAS remote sensing in agricultural monitoring. Furthermore, critical examinations of the shortcomings observed in current research were also discussed. To further advance and optimize technology, analysis and monitoring methods, we identify crucial future research needs and directions: (1) Advancements in equipment and application scenarios, (2) Enhanced exploration of UAS multi-source data fusion, (3) Developments in methodology for agricultural monitoring, and (4) Expanding the scope of remote sensing applications in agricultural monitoring. The first two advancements will provide sufficient discriminative information, while the latter improvements will enhance the efficiency and generalizability of ML and DL methods for processing multi-platform remote sensing data. These developments will broaden the application of low-altitude UAS remote sensing in precision agriculture for improved crop information acquisition and analysis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The rapid growth of the media industry, particularly social media, has enhanced interaction and information sharing but has also led to harmful uses of cyberspace, such as cyberbullying. This phenomenon, primarily affecting adolescents, involves repeated harm through electronic devices in forms like abusive or aggressive text messages, inappropriate videos, and identity theft. The present study utilizes the Scopus database to analyze 5201 publications on cyberbullying from 1999 to 2023. Using various bibliometric network methods for analysis such as networks, citation, co-citation, collaboration, and keyword co-occurrence networks, along with intellectual structure maps, we identified key contributors and publications from this field. The study identifies significant growth in scientific output over the years, with prominent contributors like Michelle F. Wright, Heidi Vandebosch, and Rosario Ortega-Ruiz, and key journals including Computers in Human behavior, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, and Journal of Interpersonal Violence. The United States leads research production, with substantial collaboration among American institutions, followed by Canada and the United Kingdom. This study recognizes social media, gender, and online abuse as key topics well-explored in studies on cyberbullying. However, further investigation is required in fields such as cyber dating violence and harassment, along with the associated challenges faced by sexual minorities. Our results show a growing research interest among academics in understanding the various aspects of cyberbullying in recent years. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Energy technology assessment is a systematic evaluation of energy technologies, making it relevant in energy transition research. However, trends in energy technology assessment research remain largely unknown. Combining a bibliometric and content analysis of some key documents, this study explored the conceptual evolution of 2438 documents in energy technology assessment published from 1976 to 2023. The study used the Scopus database to collect data and analysed using Biblioshiny in RStudio, VosViewer and Microsoft Excel. The results show that ‘energy technology assessment’ has not developed as a unique field and remains rooted in the ‘technology assessment’ research. The annual growth rate of publications assessing energy technologies was 10.5% during the analysis period. One hundred and sixteen countries have contributed to the energy technology assessment research. The co-occurrence analysis results revealed four broad themes: ‘sustainable development’, ‘energy transition technologies’, ‘technology assessment methods’ and ‘energy system’. Surprisingly, the keyword ‘energy transition’ minimally features in the sampled documents but seems to be emerging. The diverse keywords observed indicate the interdisciplinary perspective required in assessing energy technologies. This study recommends theorising and positioning energy technology assessment research within the energy transition agenda to foster future growth. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Food safety is crucial for human health, and mycotoxins, produced by fungi, can contaminate food, posing a serious health threat. Understanding mycotoxin production, toxicity mechanisms, and accurate detection is essential for food safety. While many studies have explored these aspects, there is still room for improvement in detection methods for mycotoxins. Taking mycotoxins as an entry point, this paper systematically collected and analyzed mycotoxin-related literatures from mainstream databases by combining bibliometric analysis, revealing the development trend and research focuses in this field, confirming mycotoxin detection methods as the core of this review, and further discussing chromatography-based, spectrometry-based, immunoassay-based, biosensor-based, and other. Research advances and limitations of mycotoxin detection methods, such as high sensitivity versus cumbersome processing for chromatography, low cost for spectroscopy, and high specificity for immunoassays, were further discussed. Emerging technologies like immunoassays and biosensors show promise for rapid and portable detection. Challenges in sample preparation and matrix effects are also discussed. Meanwhile, by analyzing the development trend of mycotoxin detection methods, it is predicted that the future research focus will be mainly on the two aspects of highly sensitive and accurate detection and rapid and accurate on-site detection. This review aims to provide insights for the field's development, predict future trends in mycotoxin analysis, and enhance food safety and public health protection. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the segmentation of liver structures in medical images has become a popular research focus in the past half-decade. The performance of AI tools in screening for this task may vary widely and has been tested in the literature in various datasets. However, no scientometric report has provided a systematic overview of this scientific area. This article presents a systematic and bibliometric review of recent advances in neuronal network modeling approaches, mainly of deep learning, to outline the multiple research directions of the field in terms of algorithmic features. Therefore, a detailed systematic review of the most relevant publications addressing fully automatic semantic segmenting liver structures in Computed Tomography (CT) images in terms of algorithm modeling objective, performance benchmark, and model complexity is provided. The review suggests that fully automatic hybrid 2D and 3D networks are the top performers in the semantic segmentation of the liver. In the case of liver tumor and vasculature segmentation, fully automatic generative approaches perform best. However, the reported performance benchmark indicates that there is still much to be improved in segmenting such small structures in high-resolution abdominal CT scans. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The development of technology has revolutionized the world of education. Augmented Reality (AR) is one of the media that is starting to be developed for the learning process. AR has become a potential tool to improve the learning process among children. This study aims to systematically review previous research related to the application of AR to develop students' gross motor skills in early childhood education. The data collection process was carried out using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method which was adapted in this study. Identification results from five databases (SCOPUS, Pubmed, OpenAlex, Google Scholar, and Crossref) obtained 2807 publication documents. Bibliometric analysis was conducted on 1938 eligible articles, and 10 articles were selected as a literature review. The results of the bibliometric analysis showed less significant results on AR research in developing early childhood motor skills. However, overall AR research in early childhood education has experienced significant development. More attention and focus is needed regarding the development of early childhood motor skills research through the integration of AR technology. Thus, AR research in early childhood education is not limited to cognitive, but also focuses on motor skills as well. © Copyright: Federación Española de Asociaciones de Docentes de Educación Física (FEADEF)

AB  - Background: Depression is a common mental disorder in children and adolescents, with a global prevalence of approximately 33%, severely affecting their physical, mental health, and academic performance. This study aims to identify and assess the 100 most-cited articles (T100 articles) on depression in children and adolescents. Methods: The T100 articles in the field of depression were retrieved from the SCI-E and SSCI databases. A comprehensive analysis of the T100 articles was conducted, including the number of citations, countries, journals, keywords, authors, and topics. Results: Between 1981 and 2021, T100 articles in child and adolescent depression received 423 to 3949 citations. Most articles originated from the USA, with Kovacs M as the top-ranked author. The University of Pittsburgh and Columbia University published the top two T100 articles. The T100 articles were published in 36 journals, led by AMA Psychiatry. Co-occurrence keywords analyses reveal six key foci: Pathogenesis of Depression, Treatment of MDD in Children, Early Childhood Treatment, Adolescent Depression Manifestations, Gender and Depression, and Primary Care Considerations, with pathogenesis as a future trend. Conclusions: Our research presents an exhaustive list of the most highly cited articles on depression in children and adolescents. Our findings not only underscore the significance of international cooperation but also reveal a pressing need to prioritize and bolster preventive research, particularly the development and refinement of early screening and intervention programs. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - As the significance of rare earth elements (REEs) as a strategic resource in the industrial economy and the scarcity of the resource itself gain prominence worldwide, technologies for capturing and recovering REEs from wastewater are crucial for a sustainable future. To gain a comprehensive insight into research focuses and emerging trends related to the recovery of REEs from wastewater, the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) database was used for the literature search. Bibliometrix, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace software were employed for bibliometric analysis of research literature published between 2000 and 2023, investigating aspects such as the prominent contributing countries/regions, prolific authors, source journals, and major research institutions. The results revealed a steady increase in research pertaining to the recovery of REEs from wastewater during the studied period. China, India, and the USA were identified as leading contributors, with the Chinese Acad Sci being recognized as the most productive institution. Based on the co-occurrence and burst analysis of keywords, it was found that the adsorption and solvent extraction of REEs from wastewater currently dominate current research, with the development of emerging technologies such as the electrochemical method and biological extraction method representing potential future hotspots. Additionally, emerging types of highly selective and high-capacity adsorbents for REEs are anticipated to become a prominent area of interest. This paper provided a comprehensive overview of the current state of the recovery of REEs from wastewater and forecasts future trends, offering a valuable reference for understanding the evolving dynamics in this field. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of brackish water resources in agriculture is a promising alternative to overcome water scarcity issues under global change and to implement Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 6.3. Meanwhile, according to the World Bank report in 2020, bad water quality can lead to the worldwide loss of food up to 9.54 trillion kilocalories per year. The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence-based technologies is a promising opportunity to modernize irrigation water quality (IWQ) management. This review endeavors to provide a comprehensive overview of the extent to which Machine Learning (ML) models overcome the limitations of conventional methods. This paper began with an introduction section focusing on the background research, followed by a bibliometric analysis of IWQ. Subsequently, a comprehensive review is presented, including discussions on model performances, data availability, and existing limitations. The review revealed that there is a potential accuracy of the ML models to develop ML-based sensor technologies for monitoring IWQ. However, it highlights the need to improve the applicability of ML models through selecting appropriate input and output variables, as it was approved that the efficiency of ML models not only depends on the prediction accuracy but also on the used variables. Overall, this review presents prospective directions to overcome the current limitations with a particular focus on the practical application and integration of the ML models into innovative technologies to manage IWQ. © 2024

AB  - In recent decades, research on treatment and recycling of construction and demolition waste (CDW) has rapidly increased due to its substantial environmental, social, and economic impacts. Despite the growing interest in this field, there is a noticeable lack of comprehensive and systematic analysis offering a clear overview of the development context and quantitative trends. To address this gap, this study conducted a systematic bibliometric overview that covers publishing trends, collaborative networks among countries, institutions and research teams, co-citation analysis of literatures, and keyword co-occurrence analysis using literature data-driven visualization. Research trends and future perspectives were identified based on the results and comprehensive review as well as the keywords clusters visualized by literature data. These perspectives highlight several research opportunities. (1) Advanced technologies for CDW treatment are underutilized, which necessitates government involvement and a national disposal charging system. (2) There is a lack of interdisciplinary integration in CDW research. (3) A universally applicable life cycle assessment system for CDW recycling needs to be developed. (4) Research on heavy metal migration and long-term stability in recycled CDW is limited. (5) More studies on CDW reduction in the design stage are warranted, with emphasis on urban planning, building quality, design optimization, and resource estimation. These findings not only enhance understanding of the research trends in treatment and recycling of CDW but also for provide insights for practitioners and researchers at the evolving frontiers of the field. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recent literature on the utilization of Heat Pipes in Battery Thermal Management Systems (BTMS-HP) has highlighted advancements and alternatives in the field. The existing literature on BTMS-HP technology is limited and lacks cohesive key information, which presents research hurdles for new researchers. Moreover, research and innovation rely on data-driven approaches, emphasizing the need for identifying key information for analysis, perspectives and mitigating technological risks. To achieve this, a comprehensive scientific mapping is conducted by extracting crucial insights and key knowledge from the dispersed literature of BTMS-HP technology for critical review. The key findings of this study are the trends for the last two decades shedding light on both the maturity and real-world applications of BTMS-HP methods, main contributors (countries, researchers, and production sources) to BTMS-HP technology, and the keywords emphasis in-depth of various novel and perspective areas related to the field. The scientific mapping key highlights a total of 610 publications in the field, showing three distinct phases of growth, with China, the USA, and India emerging as dominant contributors. Top 3 publication sources are “Applied Thermal Engineering”, “Journal of Energy Storage” and “International journal of heat & mass transfer”. The keyword analysis discusses various techniques employed to cool and preheat batteries using HP. Overall, the field of BTMS-HP is still in research phase, numerous methods have been implemented for improving BTMS with many focusing on results of temperature reduction and enhancing power output while overlook cost-effective strategies for power improvement. It is recommended that each method undergoes a detailed 4E (Energy, Exergy, Economic, and Environmental) analysis. Most studies have concentrated on battery surface cooling, there's a need for further research to compare the effectiveness of tab cooling versus battery surface cooling. Utilizing machine learning to optimize design parameters can be effective in reducing the weight of BTMS systems by accurately predicting battery temperatures. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Landscape sustainability and land sustainability are interrelated and complementary research fields, rooted respectively in ecological and geographic sciences, but both embracing sustainability as their ultimate goal. However, it is not clear how these two fields have developed in recent decades, and whether they have interacted synergistically to advance the science and practice of sustainability. Thus, here we have conducted a bibliometric comparison of these two fields using multiple quantitative methods, including trend analysis, theme mining, citation network analysis, and collaboration network analysis, further augmented by qualitative synthesis. We have found: (1) both research fields have entered a period of rapid development around 2010, following their incubation and emerging phases; (2) landscape sustainability research has focused primarily on the biodiversity-ecosystem function-ecosystem services-human wellbeing nexus in changing landscapes, whereas land sustainability research has concentrated primarily on the causes, dynamics, and impacts of land use and land cover change, as well as sustainable land use and management; (3) Cross-referencing between the two fields is rare, reflecting weak interactions between the two scientific communities. Thus, although some interdisciplinary teams and individual researchers have begun to work together across the two fields, landscape sustainability and land sustainability, as two research fields, remain largely independent of each other. To enhance their synergistic interactions, we recommend that scientists and practitioners from both fields promote joint professional organizations and conferences, and foster broad-scale collaborative projects together to improve the sustainability of landscapes and regions in theory and practice. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Focal therapy, a minimally invasive strategy for localized prostate cancer, has been widely employed in the targeted treatment of localized prostate cancer in recent years. We analyzed 1312 relevant papers from the last decade using Web of Science Core Collection data. Our analysis covered countries, institutions, journals, authors, keywords, and references to offer a multifaceted perspective on the development of this field. The U.S. led in publications, contributing over half of the top 10 institutions. Emberton, M from University College London was the most published and cited author. “EUROPEAN UROLOGY” was the top journal by impact factor in 2022. Analysis of references and keywords suggests the prevalence of brachytherapy-related research, while high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), cryotherapy, and irreversible electroporation (IRE) are emerging as new research focuses. Consequently, more high-quality evidence is necessary to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of these novel therapeutic methods. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Interpersonal trust is essential for societal well-being, underpinning relationships from individuals to institutions. Neuroscience research on trust has advanced swiftly since 2001. While quantitative reviews, meta-analyses, and theoretical frameworks have effectively synthesized trust neuroscience research, bibliometric analysis remains underutilized. Our bibliometric analysis aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of trust neuroscience's current state and future directions by examining its historical development, key contributors, geographic distribution, methodological paradigms, influential works, thematic trends, and overall impact. This field has been characterized by the input of a few key contributors through international collaboration, with significant contributions from the U.S., China, the Netherlands, and Germany. Research predominantly utilizes the trust game and fMRI, with a rising focus on neural networks, general trust, and differentiating behavioral from attitudinal trust. Integrating insights from psychology, economics, and sociology, this interdisciplinary field holds promise for advancing our understanding of trust through a neurobiological lens. In conclusion, our bibliographic literature review provides valuable insights and guidance for scholars, spotlighting potential avenues for further investigation in this fast-growing field. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Aggression is a common problem in psychiatric clinics, and many studies have been conducted on the issue over the years. This study bibliometrically examines the characteristics and trends of aggression studies in psychiatry, such as the branches, publication years, types, publishers, and impact factors, and compares the focus areas of psychiatry and psychiatric nursing on aggression, to guide future research and readers on this topic. Bibliometric analysis was performed with network metrics, citation analysis, co-authorship analysis, science mapping, and network visualization techniques using WoS analysis reports and the VOSviewer program with data obtained from the Web of Science database on January 11, 2024. Results: Most studies on aggression in psychiatry were published in 2019 as English articles. Then, 3.37% of these studies are in psychiatric nursing, mainly from Australia. In contrast, most psychiatric studies are from the USA. Psychiatry studies focus on causes, types, and relationships with psychiatric disorders, while psychiatric nursing studies emphasize aggressive attitudes, risk assessment, and aggression management. Conclusions: It appears that studies on aggression continue to remain current in the literature and will continue to do so, considering that aggression is an ongoing clinical problem worldwide. Despite this, studies on assessing and managing the risk of aggression are still lacking. Future studies should prioritize the management of aggression. While the study showed the presence of multidisciplinary and international collaborations, it is recommended that these collaborations be further expanded. Findings may inform researchers’ keyword and journal choices. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The limitations of the sensing capabilities of earth observation sensors have allowed for the advancement of robust high-resolution technologies that are flexible and easy to operate at a low cost, especially in the context of mapping and monitoring the health of crops such as tomatoes in the global south. Although a lot of research efforts have been exerted towards assessing the literature on remote sensing of tomato crops, there are very limited studies that have quantitatively and systematically assessed the findings of those studies to identify the most optimal, sensors, spectral features, modelling algorithms as well as the spatial distribution of those studies. In this regard, this work assessed the progress, opportunities, challenges, and gaps of remote sensing techniques used in characterizing the productivity of tomato crops. Seventy-four articles were retrieved and systematically reviewed from Google scholar, Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science databases. Results showed that about 44 % of the studies retrieved were conducted in Europe, with the most contributions coming from Italy, while a few studies were from Africa. The contribution of biomass, LAI, chlorophyll, and canopy yield was explored as the most prominent attributes and proxies for estimating the productivity of tomato crops. The most widely used sensors and algorithms which exhibit optimal accuracies in tomato productivity are Hyperspectral sensors (ASD), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Sentinel 2 Multispectral instruments (MSI), multi-variate techniques, and Machine Learning algorithms. The community of practitioners remains challenged by the high acquisition costs or remotely sensed data and weather constraints due to the restricted spatial properties of sensors in mapping and monitoring crop health to optimise agricultural productivity. © 2024

AB  - Uncertainty in the environment poses a significant challenge for supply chain management, and uncertainty theory is a branch of mathematics that focuses on analyzing uncertain phenomena. In this context, an increasing number of scholars have begun to use the uncertainty theory to study uncertain phenomena in the supply chain management, but there is still a lack of systematic literature reviews and research outlooks in this research field. To fill this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive and systematic review of the relevant literature in the Web of Science database from 2015 to May 2024 using bibliometric analysis and content analysis. First, bibliometric analysis is conducted to visualize the current state of research, including publication trends, keywords, authors, and geographical distribution. Then, through content analysis, the selected literature is categorized into seven subfields according to the research questions, including supply chain pricing decision, supply chain network disruption, supply chain network design, supply chain management considering sales efforts, sustainable supply chain management, supply chain contract design, and general supply chain management. The results indicate that the literature on the supply chain management based on the uncertainty theory is not yet mature. The research has begun to shift from single uncertainty to multidimensional uncertainty and from single-objective decision-making to multi-objective decision-making. The research direction has also shifted towards sustainability and resilience design in supply chain networks, gradually incorporating environmental and social benefits into supply chain decision-making. Based on the results of the bibliometric analysis and content analysis, future research directions are identified and potential related research opportunities are proposed, including the impact of consumer behavior, channel interaction, corporate social responsibility, and logistics service strategies on the supply chain management based on the uncertainty theory. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Background: Male involvement in Family Planning (FP) is an exercise of men’s sexual and reproductive health rights. However, the measurement of male involvement has been highly inconsistent and too discretional in FP studies. As a result, we used bibliometric tools to analyze the existing measures of male involvement in FP and recommend modifications for standard measures. Methods: Using developed search terms, we searched for research articles ever published on male involvement in FP from Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases. The search results were filtered for studies that focused on Africa. A total of 152 research articles were selected after the screening, and bibliometric analysis was performed in R. Results: Results showed that 54% of the studies measured male involvement through approval for FP, while 46.7% measured it through the attitude of males to FP. About 31% measured male involvement through input in deciding FP method, while others measured it through inputs in the choice of FP service center (13.6%), attendance at FP clinic/service center (17.8%), and monetary provision for FP services/materials (12.4%). About 82.2% of the studies used primary data, though the majority (61.2%) obtained information on male involvement from women alone. Only about one in five studies (19.1%) got responses from males and females, with fewer focusing on males alone. Conclusion: Most studies have measured male involvement in FP through expressed or perceived approval for FP. However, these do not sufficiently capture male involvement and do not reflect women’s autonomy. Other more encompassing measures of male involvement, which would reflect the amount of intimacy among heterosexual partners, depict the extent of the exercise of person-centered rights, and encourage the collection of union-specific data, are recommended. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Neuropsychological evaluations are valuable in neurosurgery because they comprehensively evaluate cognitive, affective, and behavioral functioning to optimize patient outcomes. Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into neuropsychology offers optimistic advances, with machine learning models assisting in classifying behavioral, cognitive, and functional impairments while minimizing the number of tests. AI-based approaches have demonstrated accurate classification outcomes, providing potential alternatives to time-consuming and non-ecological conventional evaluations. This research uses data from the Scopus database to examine the trends of neuropsychological-based AI in cognitive neuroscience, mental health, and neurodegenerative disorders. The study emphasized the potential of artificial intelligence in neuropsychology research and identified several research themes. The analysis of bibliometrics may efficiently assess the developments and impact of neuropsychology research, providing insights into academic output and predicting future trends. Future research should consider utilizing alternative databases, employing a multisource strategy, incorporating additional keywords, and building upon the foundational knowledge provided by this study. Despite its limitations, this study provides significant insights and paves the way for future neuropsychology-based artificial intelligence research. Furthermore, investigating significant topics and key issues in the neuropsychology and artificial intelligence debate adds new perspectives to the corpus of literature. This analysis can help identify gaps, controversies, and areas of future exploration within the field. The study also highlights the importance of learning and intelligent computation in neuropsychology, providing a conceptual methodology based on a comprehensive review of the most recent research. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic sped up the digitalization process and revolutionized the world of the digital employee. And today, advances in artificial intelligence are having a major impact on the field of Digital HR. In that context, further literature review work is needed on the term Digital HR to complement previous studies and lay the foundation for more pioneering literature on this topic. Then, the aim of this paper is to provide a framework for organizing the main themes discussed in the pioneering literature on digital HR by answering the following research question: What is the knowledge structure of the research in the field of digital human resources? An adaptation of the PRISMA model is used to structure the research design. Applying a mixed methodology, this paper uses a bibliometric technique to identify the main topics studied in Digital HR. Subsequently, in-depth analysis and logical reasoning are applied and a model is proposed based on four questions (how, what, where, who) in order to understand and develop research on digital HR. The RQ4 Digital-HR model constitutes a useful tool in academic, practical, professional, and social contexts. It is worth highlighting the importance of the inclusion of artificial intelligence in the daily processes of a company, and therefore in the progress of the proposed research topic. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Currently, global warming, invasive alien species and tourism development pose major threats to Natural World Heritage sites, and the strengthening of conservation methods and management programs in buffer zones is urgent for the sustainable development of sites. Agroforestry, as a nature-based solution, not only promotes the buffer zone to effectively maintain the Outstanding Universal Value of the heritage site, but also balances the relationship between the conservation of the heritage site and the economic development of the buffer zone, and effectively enhances the protection of the buffer zone in response to various threats. However, there is currently a lack of comprehensive understanding of research trends, research focuses, and recent developments, regarding the conservation of natural heritage sites and buffer zone agroforestry development. Therefore, this study utilized the Scopus database along with Excel and Bibliometrix software to conduct a bibliometric analysis and explore and visualize popular research topics and foreword issues related to Natural World Heritage conservation and buffer zone agroforestry development. We discuss the current publication trends and quantity, keyword and abstract word frequencies, thematic maps and evolutions, journal productivity, national publication outputs, collaboration relationships, and contributing institutions. The research shows that the relationship between biodiversity conservation and agroforestry has been the focus of research in the field since 1992, and the development of agroforestry has contributed to biodiversity conservation in heritage sites. However, there have been fewer studies addressing the geomorphic and aesthetic value of agroforestry conservation, and little attention has been paid to buffer zone development. Based on this, this manuscript suggests that in the future, emphasis should be placed on the linkage between the development of buffer zones and heritage conservation, especially in the Karst World Heritage Sites with ecologically fragile, and that the role of agroforestry development in buffer zones should be strengthened in the promotion of ecological balance and sustainable development of the sites, to provide scientific references for the conservation and development of other geoheritage sites around the globe. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Introduction: Assessing the methodological quality of economic evaluations (EEs) is crucial for evidence-based decision-making. The study aimed to evaluate EEs in restorative dentistry and endodontics, while also analyzing the scientific landscape of researchers and publications through co-authorship and citation network analysis providing an insight into the distribution of scientific expertise. Methodology: A systematic search for relevant articles from 2012 to 2022 was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and EBSCO. The ten-point Drummond checklist was used to appraise the methodological quality of included studies. Bibliometric data for network analysis were extracted from the Dimensions database and visualized using VOSviewer software. Results: Of the 37 articles, 81.08% scored good, 16.21% average, and 2.7% poor on the methodological rating scale. Most of the included studies were in Q1 journals, with limited representation in Q2 and Q3 journals. Compliance was highest in Q2 journals (95%), followed by Q1 (88.36%), while it dropped to 40% for Q3 journals. Co-authorship analysis revealed a dense network of researchers, with Prof. Falk Schwendicke V. having a significant influence. Moreover, the Journal of Dentistry had the highest impact, followed by Journal of Endodontics and BMC Oral Health. Conclusions: Despite a diverse scientific landscape, participation from developing countries was limited emphasizing the need for inclusivity and diversity in the scientific network. While the quantity of good-quality studies was encouraging, the overall quality of evidence remains paramount for decision-making in healthcare policy and practice. Therefore, continuous efforts to improve methodological rigor and reporting practices are essential to contribute robust evidence. © The Author(s) 2024.

Biodiversity finance can be a way to strengthen the agriculture sector and attain sustainable development goals (SDGs). It is a relatively new concept and is still in its developing stage. It requires an in-depth bibliometric analysis highlighting the past, present, and future trends in the agriculture sector from the SDGs perspective. Therefore, a bibliometric study is conducted from 1985 to 2024. Data is extracted from the Scopus database. Results are evident in the increasing trend of publications and citations. The scope of biodiversity finance is not limited to finance but is also theoretically linked with other areas: economics, environmental, and social sciences. The most prominent SDG for framing the research questions is SDG 15 with SDGs (2, 3, 13, 14). The USA is the most productive country, with the highest multiple and single-country productions, and about 60 % of the top ten institutions are in the USA. It included the network and content analysis to explore the homogeneous research areas and determine potential future directions. Furthermore, the study highlighted four research streams: (1) integrated strategies for agricultural financing, development, and governance, (2) strategic approach to biodiversity conservation and financial management, (3) sustainable development and finance, and (4) biodiversity financing for sustainable agriculture. The findings highlight the significance of financial incentives to support sustainable biodiversity management that can help in agricultural revitalization and accomplishing SDGs. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are pervasive organic pollutants in the environment. PAHs originate from natural and anthropogenic sources, and are associated with incomplete combustion of organic matter. PAHs can pose a substantial health risk, including teratogenicity, immune suppression, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity. Several studies explored PAHs remediation using varied methods, each with merits and drawbacks. This review compiles diverse methods, offering an overview of multidimensional approaches for remediating PAH-contaminated soils, with a particular emphasis on hybrid technique. The exploration comprehends physical techniques like thermal desorption and electrokinetic remediation, chemical methods including oxidation and photocatalytic remediation, and biological approaches such as phytoremediation and microbial degradation. The integration of these diverse methods reflects a holistic and sustainable approach to address the challenges posed by PAHs-polluted sites. Phytoremediation is eco-sustainable, cost-effective, but time-consuming, while hybrid approaches offer enhanced PAH removal in short time. In comparison to microbial degradation and advanced computational methods, thermal and electrokinetic methods are costly and less eco-friendly. Research in PAHs remediation is increasingly leaning towards the following sequence: hybrid methods < chemical/physical methods < biological methods. Focusing on hybrid remediation, the physical-chemical methods hold the highest research prevalence at 53 %, followed by chemical-biological at 37 %, and the least in the physical-biological category at 10 %. This review advocates for hybrid remediation methods, which can serve as a bridge between environmental sustainability and remediation efficiency. Challenges remain in optimizing these technologies, ensuring economic feasibility, and connecting knowledge gaps. Future research may prioritize on remediation proficiency with innovation, and ensuring long-term environmental sustainability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Due to the deepening levels of port automation and intelligence, the degree of equipment automation and the complexity of maintenance operations have increased substantially. Consequently, the evolution of intelligent technology has led to significant shifts in the types and quantities of issues encountered during the actual operation of equipment compared to historical contexts. The prevailing understanding of equipment maintenance systems might restrict ports' capacity to handle emergencies and exacerbate operational risks. This paper employs bibliometric methods to analyze the current state of cooperation, key focus areas, and emerging trends in port equipment maintenance. Additionally, the study conducts a critical analysis and systematic investigation based on the bibliometric results. The findings indicate that intelligent technology introduces novel methodologies for port equipment maintenance. Nevertheless, multiple challenges remain in applying intelligent technologies, such as data integration, fault tracking, and real-time diagnosis. The paper emphasizes that future research should concentrate on enhancing data fusion capabilities, improving fault management effectiveness, and refining maintenance decision-making processes to elevate the intelligence of port equipment. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This study explores orientations in the study of sustainability strategy in agribusinesses using quantitative and qualitative research methods. The quantitative aspect involved a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications in the Scopus and Web of Science databases on publications in the area of business and management, while the qualitative approach involved a systematic analysis to determine strategic orientations. The research methodology used was the Constructivist and Knowledge Development Process (Proknow-C), which includes four stages: (1) portfolio selection, (2) bibliometric analysis of the portfolio using bibliometric software, (3) systematic analysis and (4) identification of future research. The results revealed four strategic directions for sustainability: Corporate Social Responsibility, Standards and Traceability, Innovation and Environmental Performance, and Governance and Food Safety. In addition, two areas for future research were identified: corporate sustainability policies and management practices. Although there is a considerable amount of literature on sustainability, research in agribusiness is still in its infancy and there is a need to deepen the interactions between the economic, environmental and social dimensions in order to promote business strategies in agribusiness that foster sustainable development. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Plastic pollution and the associated adversities have been intensively researched recently, providing ample solutions with diverse possibilities and yielding a considerable corpus of literature in plastic waste management (PWM). Regardless of the vast range of techniques formulated, such as mechanical recycling and chemical depolymerization, many of these approaches have limitations including significant costs, ecological threats, and inefficiencies in handling diverse plastic types. Manual analysis of these challenges and the reported solutions from the vast collection of interdisciplinary research papers is extremely laborious. Herein, using tools of data science to create a network of ∼350,000 papers and subsequent clustering to identify various protocols for PWM and determining the main paths of their knowledge evolution, we review their progress. The broad objective of this analysis is to provide a comprehensive understanding of different PWM techniques, with a focus on the importance of integrated, technologically advanced, and environmentally conscious approaches to solve plastic pollution. We identify four major categories of PWM (physical, chemical, physio-chemical, and biological) and analyze their mechanistic details. Our study highlights the critical need for the establishment of more sustainable PWM methodologies, supporting the integration of artificial intelligence to refine process optimization and cultivate interdisciplinary collaboration focused on advancing a circular economy and reducing plastic waste. Together with a deep discussion on the gaps between the set goals and the current achievements identified, these analyses could be a useful tool to confront the PW crisis. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Introduction: Stroke is a life-threatening condition that increasingly damages cerebral tissue over time and can lead to serious post-effects, including depression, which can hinder a patient’s recovery from stroke and reduce quality of life. This paper aims to analyze the global research landscape of post-stroke depression (PSD) between the years 1900 to 2024 using bibliometric analysis. Methods: The data used in this analysis was collected from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). An advanced search was performed using the keywords, “stroke” and “depression,” on July 8th, 2024. From the Web of Science, bibliometric data was then extracted and analyzed in VOSviewer through four categories: countries, number of publications, keywords, and journals. Results: The bibliometric analysis resulted in 2,289 publications from the year 1900 to 2024. A gradual increase in the number of publications on post-stroke depression over the study period was observed. China was found to be the leading country for publications and funding on PSD, with the United States following in second. The top keywords included: “stroke,” “depression,” and “poststroke depression.” The Journal of Stroke had the highest number of publications on depression in post-stroke patients. Conclusion: This study provides an overview of the current trends in articles published on PSD. Depression is an important topic to be considered in post-stroke patients due to its negative effects on post-stroke recovery and reduced quality of life, necessitating a call to attention and support for future research in this field. With continued research efforts led by the United States and China, improved treatments for patients with post-stroke depression can be implemented. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - It has been widely documented that livestock cattle can play a non-negligible role in natural landscapes due to climate change, deforestation, and enteric methane emissions. Alternatively, sustainable protocols and market digitalization are highlighted as promising tools to mitigate environmental cattle impacts by authenticated data in digital traceability systems. Digital inclusion, particularly for cattle breeders, can be a useful starting point for employing sustainable protocol in food chain production and management. This study analyzes the evolution of knowledge in the area of animal traceability to compare applied technologies found by a bibliometric analysis of articles published in Web of Science. The study evidences a clear change in thematic research over decades, currently culminating in technologies such as blockchain, IoT (Internet of Things), machine learning, and deep learning. These technologies emerge as the main research scopes in promoting transparency and reliability in the production chain, especially considering individual digital identification. However, challenges such as high investment requirements and difficulties in data accessibility, interoperability, privacy, and security implicate the low maturity level of available technologies and knowledge, therefore preventing further adoption and development of reliable worldwide animal traceability systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: The current context of information manipulation advocates computational data processing for the generation of detailed and precise information in the academic field. Objective: Present a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) supported by bibliometrics on semantic networks of concept maps (RSMC) – networks of meanings in which the nodes are concepts belonging to a collection of concept maps and the edges are semantic relations established between these concepts. Methodology: The SLR followed Kitchenham's proposal and was implemented in the online tool Parsifal. To provide breadth to the research, bib files from ACM, ScienceDirect and Engineering Village sources were included in the methodological conduction through metadata treatment, which increased the number of documents found and analyzed. Results: As a result, it was found, in relation to the specialized bibliometric procedure, that the addition of academic bases resulted in an increase in the search breadth by 56.8% and, consequently, in the results of the bibliographic and the bibliometric analysis conducted. Conclusion: In relation to the documents analyzed, the most relevant conclusions were: a) that the concept of RSMC is not yet formalized in academic literature and b) that there is continued interest in pedagogical practices involving, mainly, conceptual maps and, in addition, semantic networks and lexical semantic relations in the search scope performed. The study presented here can contribute to qualifying the practice of systematic literature review with the adoption of bibliometric procedures supported by technological tools, such as the Bibliometrix package. © 2024 Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

AB  - This study employs bibliometric analysis to systematically explore the Visual Basic (VB) education research landscape, identifying significant trends, influential authors, and future research directions. Utilizing data from Scopus-indexed journals, we examined 529 papers published between 1994 and October 2023, identified through the keywords "visual basic," "visualbasic," "teaching," and "learning." These papers were analyzed using Biblioshiny to generate a bibliometric map, following four steps: data harvesting, data screening, data visualization, and data analysis. Our research reveals critical VB programming trends from 1994 to 2023, with academic output peaking in 2010 and declining since 2007. Ongoing interest is noted due to legacy system applications. Global publication reach facilitates cross-border information exchange, and top affiliations and authors underscore extensive and influential participation in this field. The research emphasizes incorporating fundamental and advanced themes in educational curricula. It suggests future research focusing on new programming paradigms, longitudinal studies, and VB relevance to technological advancements and industrial needs. Enhanced collaboration, interdisciplinary research, and attention to global trends are essential for maintaining the relevance of VB programming education, optimizing legacy systems, improving educational practices, and preparing students for modern programming environments. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - With the availability of enormous amounts of data come the difficulties of big data, privacy, and ransomware assaults, which result in Marketing fraud and spam. Blockchain offers an extensive array of possible applications in the Marketing field. Nevertheless, both Marketing research and practice exhibit a degree of hesitance toward using Blockchain technology and have not yet come around to completely understand and adopt the technology. Here, the aim is to examine the Blockchain concepts and their applications in Marketing through bibliometrics, network, and thematic analyses, which can provide several novel insights and perspectives into current research trends in this field by evaluating the most significant and cited research publications, keywords, institutions, authors' collaboration network, and finally countries that promote Industry 5.0 (I5.0) businesses. This study performs a detailed bibliometric and thematic-based Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on 124 of over 15000 research papers. Major outcomes include the identification of emerging themes such as the role of Blockchain in advertising, and dynamic pricing, as well as the need for further exploration of underdeveloped areas (e.g., consumer behavior and brand equity). The results contribute to theoretical and practical management elements and provide the groundwork for future study in this area. The overarching target of this research is to give a complete overview of applications and emerging trends of Blockchain technology in Marketing, thereby serving as a resource for future research topics for Marketing scholars and experts aiming to implement solutions based on Blockchain technology and algorithms to develop an I5.0 business. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study analyzed petanque research and development trends in the last decade. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) research method was applied in this study. The identification of past research documents used the keyword “petanque,” and 14,829 documents were obtained from five journal databases (Scopus, Pubmed, Crossref, OpenAlex, and Google Scholar). There were 1,291 articles selected that fit the inclusion criteria to be analyzed in bibliometrics. Ten articles were selected for review based on the most citations and most relevant to the research topic. The research trend analysis shows a dynamic development and a significant increase. Visualization of bibliometric analysis shows a diverse keyword network but has not yet expanded into various fields. Based on the study results, petanque was developed as an achievement sport and socialized to the public to make it more attractive. Its correlation with sports injuries also needs to be developed because sports injuries are crucial in a sport. The literature review results presented discussions related to athlete performance from several aspects and organizational management. Developments in petanque sports research that move dynamically need to be extended from various aspects and fields to make it more complex and widespread. © 2024 Federacion Espanola de Docentes de Educacion Fisica.

AB  - Objective: To produce a bibliographic source by compiling the most-cited articles about stress urinary incontinence to guide researchers for novel research topic ideas in urogynecology. Study design: We analyzed 200 most-cited articles (T200) between 1995–2022 by reviewing the Institution for Scientific Information (ISI) − Web of Science (WOS) and PubMed databases about the stress urinary incontinence. The time span-effect of publications was normalized by calculating average citations per item (ACI) index for each article. The publications were sub-classified by the publication year, journals, countries, surgical methods, and departments. Results: The median for total citation numbers and the ACI indices of T200 were 35 and 5 respectively. The top-cited articles were mostly published in USA with 91 articles (46.5 %) followed by Italy (22, 11 %), and United Kingdom (21, 10.5 %). Among T200, 149 were original research, 44 reviews, 4 meta-analyses, and 3 editorial articles. Further, 59 were about surgical procedures (of which 28 were about TOT-TVT comparison). M. Serati and L. Bruker were the most contributing authors to T200 with 19 articles. On the top of T200, the article of Pierre A. Clavien et al. (2009) sits with 6201 citations, published in the journal of “Annals of Surgery”. Conclusions: We suggest that the most-cited articles commonly conducted in the high-income countries, mostly published between 2014–2018. Best of our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing the most-cited 200 publications in urogynecology field under two different perspectives of two different disciplines, namely urology and obstetrics and gynecology. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Heritage gardens represent the cultural heritage pride of many nations, and their sustainable preservation has garnered widespread academic attention globally. Despite numerous qualitative reviews, a comprehensive quantitative analysis of heritage garden preservation literature from 2004 to 2024 is lacking. This study examines the dynamic evolution of heritage garden conservation (2004–2024) through bibliometric analysis, focusing on Research Activity and Impact, Cooperation Networks, and Knowledge Structure and Thematic Evolution. To achieve this goal, this study conducted a bibliometric analysis using the Web of Science Core Collection database. Initially, 1,540 documents were retrieved. After excluding irrelevant categories and conducting a manual review of titles, abstracts, and keywords to ensure relevance, 774 articles were selected for analysis. The analysis utilized bibliometric software tools such as VOS viewer, CiteSpace, and Biblioshiny. The results initially reveal that the period from 2010 to 2021 marked a significant increase in publication volume within the field of heritage gardens, although only 2.4% of the papers were reviews. Landscape Urban Planning and Geoheritage emerged as the most influential journals, based on their high local citation counts within the field. Additionally, collaboration networks indicated that scholars from the United States and China published the most papers, with Canadian scholars’ works having significant impact. Influenced by the evolving concepts of technology, politics, and cultural heritage, the analysis of knowledge structure and theme evolution identified ecosystem services, user perceptions, and cultural landscape impacts as recent hot topics. Future research on the sustainable preservation of heritage gardens should focus more on balancing urban development, incorporating sustainable management, and digital restoration through quantitative methods. In summary, this study offers insights into the global evolution of heritage garden preservation from 2004 to 2024, providing a valuable resource for future research and policy-making. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The prediction of time series indices in stock markets has become an area of growing interest, providing investors with an advanced insight into a country's economic prospects in the short, medium, and long term. Much of this type of prediction has been conducted using machine learning techniques, aiming to develop effective and efficient models that can provide greater accuracy in forecasting. In this context, however, single-predict model approaches have shown limitations, such as the inability to handle diverse information efficiently, the non-linearity, and chaos in financial data. In the face of these limitations, ensemble approaches emerge as a strategy to mitigate these challenges. Although these ensemble approaches can be promising, there is no structured understanding related to their application in activities to predict time series indices in stock markets. Within this context, this study aims to investigate to what extent the literature has proposed and evaluated solutions that contribute to characterizing the state of the art in predicting the Stock Market Index through ensemble machine learning approaches. Fifty-three articles resulting from a systematic review, focused on scientific production between 2017 and the first half of 2023, were analyzed. The study performs a bibliometric analysis and categorization of the results, detailing and highlighting the main themes in the field. The bibliometric analysis identifies key authors, countries, conferences, and approaches to predict the Stock Market Index. The qualitative analysis reveals the benefits arising from the combination of algorithms in mitigating accuracy problems in index prediction, as well as systematizing information to characterize the state of the art in the field of study. Our results show that combined algorithms are an effective strategy to increase accuracy in predicting the Stock Market Index, which can benefit investors and financial institutions. This paper presents the future research scope by highlighting gaps in the existing literature for developing techniques to handle concept drifts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - General-purpose technologies (GPTs) are crucial for advancing long-term economic growth. Previous research on GPTs has primarily focused on economics. However, in the innovation field, firms face greater challenges in appropriability and value creation due to GPTs' externalities. Research on GPTs in this flexible field may exhibit unique characteristics. Despite growing academic interest, related research remains fragmented, lacking a comprehensive theoretical system. Traditional literature reviews and bibliometric analyses often focus on the most cited articles, leading to citation biases and an emphasis on impact over theme discovery. Combining topic modeling with manual coding allows for the iteration of existing theories and the creation of new theoretical frameworks. Our study analyzed 532 articles on GPTs in the innovation field, identifying 11 topics using the LDA topic model. Through manual coding and the PyLDAvis visualization tool, we identified four research areas: jungle of GPTs, profiting from GPTs innovation, industrial convergence, and economic growth and wage inequality. We examined the evolutionary trajectory, and theoretical architecture of GPTs research, proposing a comprehensive framework. We urge scholars to extend GPTs research from the firm to the ecosystem level, consider the standardization and evolution of next-generation GPTs, and diversify research methods. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The topic of managers' commitment to safety is increasingly gaining the attention of scholars over the past two decades. Bibliometric analysis (Part 1) explored the managers' commitment to safety through the prism of leadership and outlined how the research on this topic developed over time. We identified the knowledge base and the intellectual structure of the research. Based on the research front and the most important terms, we proposed possible future directions in which this field might develop. Although bibliometric analysis provides a holistic and objective overview of the state of research on this topic, an in-depth insight into the research on managers' safety commitment in relation to leadership is needed. To obtain an in-depth understanding of the research topic, we conducted a systematic review of the literature presented in this paper (Part 2). The content analysis of the publications enabled us to closely examine the evolution of this research topic over the past two decades. Specifically, we explored the theoretical foundations of publications, clarified how the concept was studied in the literature, which methods were used to address the concept, identified antecedents and outcomes of managers' commitment to safety, and proposed a research agenda that would help the scholars to develop this research topic further. The results of the review shed light on the shift in the focus of publications and highlight that managers' commitment is starting to be studied as an independent concept and explored separately from the concepts of safety climate and culture. This indicates a new direction in the research where managers' commitment and leadership are at the fore. The findings of the systematic review of the literature (Part 2) complement the bibliometric analysis (Part 1) and provide a more in-depth picture of the research on managers’ commitment to safety and leadership. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Background: The global demand for climate-based sustainable development highlights issues of social justice and resource scarcity, positioning Multinational corporations (MNEs) as key players. Their economic, environmental, and social impacts underscore the need for robust sustainability measures. This paper explores MNE development and its role in achieving sustainable development goals, specifically focusing on industry, innovation, and infrastructure (SDG 9). Methods: The author employs an exploratory research method using STATISTA data on revenue and employee numbers for the top 100 European companies (2020–2022), focusing only on EU-based MNEs. Additionally, covariance analysis and the Spearman correlation method are used to examine the relationship between MNE indicators and SDG 9. Results: This study suggests looking at MNEs as the players that leverage sustainability initiatives. The authors performed several studies. The bibliometric analysis results show that seven clusters have been created to summarize prevalent topics on MNE topics. Only one is related to sustainable development, strategies for multinational corporate groups, and global sustainable development goals. Further, the authors investigated relationships between MNE and one of the sustainable development goals (SDG 9). By forming a correlation matrix, the authors identified the existence of the middle-strength relationships. The authors identified that the highest correlation coefficient exists between SDG 9 and several domains operated by MNE. Conclusions: To ensure sustainable growth, multinational corporations must meet their targets, aligning their contributions with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and supporting long-term sustainability initiatives.

AB  - The spread of antibiotic resistance is a global threat, causing elevated death rates and economic costs. A growing number of studies have focused on the removal of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in environmental settings. However, summaries and reviews of removal techniques are limited. This study examined publications on ARB and ARGs removal from 1998 to 2023 through a bibliometric approach based on the Web of Science database. Research progress during the past 26 years was analyzed by collecting annual publications, countries, journals and keywords. The number of articles related to the removal of ARB and ARGs has increased annually. The main types of ARB and ARGs, their environmental milieus and the most commonly studied removal techniques were summarized by keyword clustering. The results revealed that tetracycline- and sulfonamide-resistant bacteria are the ARB of greatest concern; that sul1, sul2, and tetA are the most frequently studied ARGs; and that municipal sewage and drinking water are the most studied ARB and ARGs transmission sites. For treatment techniques, adsorption technology is the most widely studied, and the selection of adsorption materials is particularly important, with nanomaterials and biomodified materials having great prospects for development. The combination of membrane filtration with advanced oxidation treatment or biodegradation technology is the most promising technology in this field. Our findings can inform future efforts to further reduce the distribution risks of antibiotic resistance and improve removal techniques. (Figure presented.) © Higher Education Press 2024.

AB  - Global warming and increasing pollution have become critical global issues, and, coupled depletion of traditional energy sources, have accelerated the adoption of more sustainable production systems, such as biorefineries. Biorefineries possess the capacity to integrate technologies and processes within a single facility, thereby generating biofuels, high-value-added chemical products, and energy. The current study aims to evaluate various scenarios of soybean biorefineries by employing a bibliometric analysis and network mapping to facilitate and implement technological forecasting. To achieve this objective, eight methodological steps were undertaken. The majority of studies reviewed were primarily concerned with the utilization of soybean straw and hulls, motivated by the need to address environmental challenges related to the disposal of substantial volumes of these residues. Research on the application of soy whey also emerged as significant, mainly due to its connection with soy protein isolates. The seven most promising technological avenues identified were nanocomposites, peroxidases, ethanol, green composites, biochar, films, and biodiesel. Consequently, the findings provide a bibliographic foundation for future research on the integration of soybean-derived residues, processes, and products, which could foster innovation within the biorefinery framework and lead to crucial advancements in the processes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Substantial evidence indicates that measuring leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is a useful tool that may be considered as a valuable biomarker of individual biological age, correlating with numerous chronic disorders. However, to date, there has been a lack of in-depth understanding regarding the current landscape and forthcoming developments in the LTL field. Therefore, this study aimed to utilize bibliometric methods to summarize the knowledge structure, current focus, and emerging directions in this field. Method: Scientific publications on LTL spanning the period from 2000 to 2022 were acquired from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Several bibliometric tools including CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and an online website were utilized for bibliometric analysis. The primary evaluations encompassed investigating the major contributors and their collaborative relationships among countries/regions, institutions, and authors, conducting co-citation analyses of authors, journals, as well as reference, examining reference bursts, as well as performing co-occurrence analyses of keywords. Results: There are 1818 papers with 66,668 citations identified. Both the annual publication and citation counts on LTL exhibited significant upward trends. The United States emerged as the most prominent contributor, as evidenced by the greatest volume of papers and the highest H-index value. University of California San Francisco and Aviv A were identified as the most productive institution and author in this domain, respectively. Reference analysis revealed that longitudinal study and mendelian randomization study are the most concerned research method in this field recently. Keywords analysis showed that the most concerned diseases in LTL fields were aging, inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, endocrine diseases, neurological and psychiatric diseases, and cancers. In addition, the following research directions such as “COPD”, “mendelian randomization”, “adiposity”, “colorectal cancer”, “National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHNES)”, “telomerase reverse transcriptase”, “pregnancy” have garnered increasing attention in recent times and hold the potential to evolve into research foci in the foreseeable future. Conclusion: This is the first bibliometric study that provides comprehensive overview of LTL research. The findings of this study could become valuable references for investigators to explore and address the current and emerging challenges in LTL research. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: Lung cancer ranks as one of the most rapidly growing malignancies. Which is characterized by its poor prognosis and a low survival rate due to late diagnosis and limited efficacy of conventional treatments. In recent years nanotechnology has emerged as a promising frontier in the management of lung cancer, presenting novel strategies to enhance drug administration, improve therapeutic efficiency, and mitigate side effects. This research comprehensively evaluates the current state and research trends concerning the application of nanomaterials in lung cancer through bibliometric analysis. Materials and methods: We employed a systematic approach by retrieving studies from the Scopus database that focused on nanomaterials and lung cancer between 2003 and 2023. Subsequently, we carefully selected relevant articles based on predetermined inclusion criteria. The selected publications were then subjected to bibliometric and visual analysis using softwares such as VOSviewer and Biblioshiny. Results: A total of 3523 studies that meet inclusion criteria were selected for bibliometric analysis. We observed a progressive increase in the number of annual publications from 2003 to 2023, indicating the growing interest in this field. According to our analysis, China is the primary contributor to publication output among the countries. The “Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China” was the most influential institution. Among the authors, "Dr. Jack A. Roth” and “Dr. Huang Leaf” had the highest number of publications and cited publications, respectively. The “International Journal of Nanomedicine” was found to be the most prolific journal in this field. Additionally, “Biomaterials” emerged as the most cited journal. Through keyword analysis, we identified five main research themes and future research directions; nono-immunotherapy and green synthesis are the hot topics in this research field. Conclusion: Our study summarized the key characteristics of publications in this field and identified the most influential countries, institutions, authors, journals, hot topics, and trends related to the application of nanomaterials in lung cancer. These findings contribute to the existing body of knowledge and serve as a foundation for future research endeavors in this area. More effective efforts are needed in this field to reduce the burden of lung cancer and help achieve the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: The scope of hot spring research is continuously growing, with the application of hot spring medicine emerging as a significant trend. However, there is a lack of bibliometric analyses that summarize the current state and trends of the application of hot spring medicine. Objectives: Using bibliometric analysis, this study aims to visualize and analyze the global landscape and emerging trends in hot spring research, focusing on the hotspots and future directions of hot spring medicine application. Methods: Literature from 1994 to 2023 was compiled from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database, visualized using Citespace and VOSviewer, analyzing publication trends, keyword co-occurrence, key institutions, and research directions in global hot spring studies. Similarly, literature on the application of hot spring medicine from 2000 to 2024 was also collected. Results: A total of 8020 studies on the global field of hot springs and 68 studies on the application of hot spring medicine met the inclusion criteria. Linear regression reveals significant yearly increases in publication volume (p < 0.001). Five primary research trends including applications, components, diseases, mechanisms, and regions have been identified. Japan and France emerge as the primary contributor to the medical applications of hot springs. Conclusion: Examining utilization patterns, conducting compositional tests, investigating therapeutic mechanisms, and scrutinizing geographical disparities aid in enhancing the comprehension of hot springs for medical applications. This validates the application of hot spring medicine as a frontier trend and new hotspot in hot spring research. © 2024

AB  - Asphalt mixtures absorb high levels of solar light, increasing their internal temperatures and negatively affecting their behavior. In urban areas, this leads to the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon, where extensive asphalt coverage raises microclimate temperatures. Integrating thermochromic properties into asphalt could provide a sustainable solution to mitigate UHI while maintaining the necessary mechanical performance. This research reviews the literature, scientific advances, gaps, and future perspectives on thermochromic (TCM) asphalt mixtures through bibliometric analysis and systematic review. The analysis highlights that thermochromic asphalt has recently gained significant scientific interest, with an increasing number of publications from 2013 to 2023. Notably, Hunan University in China has emerged as a leading contributor to thermochromic-related publications. The findings identify the wet method as a prevalent form of thermochromic functionalization, with 4–6% TCM content considered most suitable for thermal performance. Adding TiO2 improves optical characteristics due to its high reflectance in the Near-infrared solar spectrum. Studies using TCM binders typically show asphalt mixtures with better resistance to rutting and cracking, likely due to enhanced thermoregulation. The key knowledge gaps identified include the lack of consistent procedures across studies, the feasibility of scaling lab-based methods to field applications, and the need for experiments to assess their impact on road safety, surface characteristics, and the durability of thermochromic properties over the pavement's service life. This review highlights the promise of TCM for urban heat management and emphasizes the importance of additional research to achieve the ideal balance between thermal and mechanical properties. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is a surgery that is commonly performed on older adults to improve their quality of life. However, the increasing use of knee joint prostheses has led to a rise in the incidence of Prosthetic Joint Infections (PJI) in patients after TKA. Different clinical studies have looked at the occurrence of PJI after TKA in different regions, but they have drawn varying conclusions. To better understand this topic, we conducted a meta-analysis and bibliometric study using data from multiple databases. Our research found that the estimated prevalence of PJI after TKA is approximately 1.08% across different regions, but there is still considerable variation. Additionally, our regression analysis of sub-groups shows significant differences in follow-up periods. Furthermore, our comprehensive bibliometric analysis identifies current research trends, “hotspots” related to TKA-related PJI, influential nations, organizations, and noteworthy publications. Our analysis provides valuable insights to guide future research in this area. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Drainage is important in controlling the level of groundwater water in improving the melioration of irrigated lands in agriculture. The right choice of drainage parameters during design will allow for minimization of salt fluxes between the crop root zone and groundwater, and between drained lands and receiving water bodies. In this study, bibliometric analysis was used to identify important trends, focus areas, and regions in international irrigation and drainage research from 2017 to 2021. The data used in this analysis were taken from the online version of the Scopus database and 1492 publications met the selection criteria. Bibliometric analysis showed that all articles were published in English, with the highest publication numbers coming from the China, USA, India, Egypt, Iran, Spain and Brazil. It was revealed that 47 publications were from Central Asian countries on irrigation and drainage issue. Further information about Soviet Legacy and Current Central Asia with large areas irrigated with drainage system and with great pressure to overcome problems induced by soil salinization. To solve the above problem, existing technical conditions of drainage systems in irrigated agriculture, new technology and technical means of cleaning closed horizontal drains in the irrigation zone are necessary. Bibliometric analysis revealed that international research on irrigation and drainage would benefit from expanding scientific exchange on this topic, as well as from long-term, continuing studies and the sustainable integration of irrigation and drainage research into future agricultural and drainage system management concepts. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Despite recent emphasis, the usage of online and blended learning as instructional methodologies in higher education is still unequal, leading to variations in students’ learning experiences across structures, areas, and programs. Research on the aspects concerning educators’ adoption and adaptation of online teaching is crucial to overcome this limitation. By using the terms ‘Educators AND Online Learning AND Readiness’, 391 journal articles were listed for further analysis. Microsoft Excel was used for frequency analysis, VOSviewer to visualize data, Harzing’s Publish or Perish to compute and evaluate citation metrics, and Words Cloud to create a cluster of words that were shown in various sizes. The bibliometric criteria used in this study to summarize results includes language, topic area, research trends by year of publication, top contributors by nation, most significant institution, and name of the active source and others. This research includes a citation analysis, an authorship analysis, and keyword analysis. The results show that from 2013 to 2022, the rate of publication increased, and a spike was seen from 2019 to 2020 due to the COVID-19 epidemic. Identification of the important blended learning outcome predictors will help with the initial planning of this creative pedagogical strategy. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - In the era of the green revolution, the manufacturing sector faces intense pressure to adopt eco-friendly production practices, which can be achieved by implementing an ESG (environmental, social, governance) framework. ESG can enhance firms' performance and play an incredible role in promoting sustainable development practices. The current study conducts a bibliometric analysis to examine the ESG performance in the manufacturing sector to facilitate a green revolution. It extracted 314 documents from the Scopus and Web of Sciences databases from 1994 to 2023. The average age of the document is 34.78, and it was from 159 sources and involved 896 total authors. The study analyzed the prior literature and supporting theories, current conceptual development, and future research themes. The evolution process of ESG started in the 1960s and is still theoretically and empirically evolving to meet future challenges. Results show an increasing trend in ESG-related publications during the sample period. Journal of Cleaner Production is the primary source of publication, and China is the most prominent country in terms of correspondence and institutional affiliation. The continent-specific analysis indicates that almost 75% of the research was conducted in Asia and Europe. Four research themes were identified through co-occurrence analysis: (1) framework for social, financial, and environmental performance, (2) sustainable models for innovative environmental investment, (3) manufacturing practices and governance issues, and (4) application for eco-friendly production and economic growth. The findings suggest that the manufacturing sector can lead toward a more sustainable and equitable future through a steadfast commitment to ESG performance that can lead to a global green revolution. Further, it outlines the potential future directions integrated into the discourse on sustainable manufacturing. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Silver (Ag) doped titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles are promising photocatalysts for the degradation of emerging pollutants. These nanocomposites enhance the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 in visible light, suppress the e-/h+ rearrangement, and enhance their bactericidal properties. This review proposes a bibliometric analysis that elucidates research trends, and important topics on contaminant degradation, analyzes the advantages and limitations of different synthesis techniques (solvothermal, photochemical reduction, sol-gel, and others), their properties to produce Ag/TiO2, and their potential for pollutant degradation. Thus, depending on the technique chosen, Ag doping of TiO2 can offer high stability, recyclability for more than 3 cycles, customized morphologies and sizes, among others. Applications of Ag/TiO2 include wastewater treatment, antibacterial surfaces, food packaging, implants, and others. Advances in the synthesis of Ag/TiO2 photocatalysts offer excellent photocatalytic degradation, between 80 % and 100 %, for organic dyes, hormones, pharmaceuticals, pesticides and other emerging pollutants. Ag/TiO2 photocatalysts show superior degradation rates compared to pure TiO2, with some achieving up to 99 % pollutant removal. The bibliometric analysis performed by Methodi Ordinatio, classifying 267 articles, reveals a foundation of relevant articles, around 35 % of articles published on these topics were published between 2019 and 2021. A complete cost analysis of Ag/TiO2 is considered to determine the feasibility for pilot and large-scale experimentation. These nanocomposites offer a promising solution to address the growing concern about emerging pollutants, disinfection of water, and in the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Forest fires pose significant environmental challenges globally, profoundly affecting watershed hydrology. As human activities increase and climate change exacerbates, the incidence and severity of forest fires have escalated, leading to profound modifications in watershed hydrological behavior. This review synthesizes findings from numerous studies conducted between 1966 and May 2024, focusing on the short- and long-term effects of forest fires on watershed runoff, peak flow, sediment transport, and water quality. Key findings include significant increases in runoff volume and peak flow, with post-fire runoff in some regions increasing by up to 500 %. Fires also alter soil properties, reducing infiltration and increasing erosion. These changes persist over time, impacting groundwater recharge, baseflow, and water quality. Elevated levels of phosphorus, nitrate, and other pollutants in post-fire runoff present risks to aquatic ecosystems and human health, with potential for eutrophication and contamination of drinking water. The study highlights regional differences in hydrological responses to forest fires, with Mediterranean regions experiencing rapid runoff increases, while boreal forests exhibit more gradual hydrological changes. This review also discusses the methodologies employed, including hydrological models and remote sensing technologies, and outlines future research needs to address gaps in our understanding of fire-watershed interactions. Improved management strategies are essential to mitigate the hydrological impacts of increasing fire activity in forested regions worldwide. © 2024

AB  - Plastics offer several benefits, such as durability, versatility, and cost-effectiveness, which have led to their pervasive use in nearly every aspect of modern life. However, their widespread use has led to significant environmental concerns. One of the major issues is their persistence in the environment, where they accumulate and cause contamination. This problem is particularly severe with plastic packaging and microparticles used in cosmetic products. As a result, the cosmetics industry started producing environmentally sustainable glitter. “Biodegradable” glitter is available in distinct compositions, mainly with a central base composed of a biodegradable material. This review focuses on academic research and patents related to glitter and biodegradable glitter, aiming to classify and compare commercially available options. Furthermore, this review analyzes scientific research on conventional glitter and its conclusions regarding environmental impact. For this, we used the keywords “glitter,” “biodegradable glitter,” “eco-friendly glitter,” “natural glitter,” and “sustainable glitter” in the databases of Wiley, Science Direct, Springer, and Clarivate Analytics ISI—Web of Science. We also performed a bibliometric analysis using the keyword “glitter” in the Web of Science database to obtain a bibliometric map of publication trends in the field using VOSviewer software. The products identified in the search were analyzed for their components and biodegradation potential. These products were classified as “biodegradable” if they were composed entirely of biodegradable constituents and as “eco-friendly” if only a portion of their constituents was biodegradable. We observed that several glitter products are incorrectly classified as biodegradable, demonstrating the need for standardized terminology that accurately reflects the composition of the glitter particles. Patent applications indicate a growing interest in developing environmentally safe glitter particles in recent years. Studies on conventional glitter mainly focus on its environmental impact or discuss analyzes for the identification and classification of glitter particles. The data gathered highlight the gaps in the field, mainly related to glitter production methods and the standardization of biodegradable glitter. Thus, studies in this direction are highly necessary. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive bibliometric review of the scientific literature on women’s entrepreneurship in agriculture across developed and developing countries. The paper delineates the evolving landscape, challenges, and opportunities that shape women’s entrepreneurship experiences in agriculture in the contexts of developed and developing countries. Through a detailed bibliometric analysis of 728 papers from 1992 to 2022, employing performance analysis and science mapping, our methodology distinguishes itself by quantifying contributions and mapping the thematic evolution within this domain. Our study reveals the significant contributions of women entrepreneurs to agricultural innovation, sustainability, and rural development while facing systemic biases, limited access to resources, and societal stereotypes that hinder their entrepreneurial path. The paper underscores the disparity in women’s entrepreneurship between developed and developing regions, with developed countries showcasing lower participation rates in agricultural entrepreneurship but a higher presence in decision-making roles within agribusinesses. In contrast, developing countries display a higher engagement of women in entrepreneurship, driven by necessity and marked by significant contributions to food security and economic stability, though under challenging conditions. Notably, the paper highlights the underrepresentation of women’s agricultural endeavours in scholarly research, pointing to a gap in the documentation and understanding of their contributions. The study reveals emerging themes such as digital agriculture, climate resilience, sustainability, and innovation, pointing towards future research directions that could further empower women in agriculture. It calls for more inclusive research and policy-making to recognise and support women’s vital role in agriculture, advocating for a holistic approach to address women entrepreneurs’ challenges in different economic contexts. Through this analysis, the paper contributes to a deeper understanding of gender dynamics in agricultural entrepreneurship and suggests pathways for fostering more equitable and sustainable agricultural practices. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Purpose: Patient experience is fundamental to Patient-Centered Care (PCC). Although prior bibliometric research studies have focused on various aspects of PCC, a comprehensive analysis of PREM articles is required to understand its impact on the clinical practices. This study aims to analyze the top 100 most-cited PREM articles to examine the critical studies and related trends. Methods: The 100 most cited articles on PREM were gathered from the Web of Science using a combination keyword search approach. The following information was extracted: study design, sample size, topic, number of citations, authorship, country, year of publication, journal title, and dimensions included in these PREM instruments. The VOSviewer software was used to generate graphical bibliometric networks. Results: The citation count of the top 100 PREM articles varied from 20 to 775 citations. 21 articles had received a minimum of 100 citations. All the articles were in English, and out of these 45% were from the USA. The cross-sectional study (69%) was the most common study design, and the impact of treatment (44%) was the most frequent topic. The common PREM instruments used were customized PREM questionnaires (16%) and HCAHPS (10%). Conclusion: This bibliometric research showed that the area of PREM is far from being saturated. The authors have attempted to provide an overview of global PREM research. Future research should focus on studies from underdeveloped and developing countries to develop condition–specific PREM tools. Longitudinal researches among special populations and studies in day-care and outpatient settings are recommended in future. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: Robotic metabolic and bariatric surgery (RMBS) has emerged as an innovative approach in the treatment of severe obesity by combining the ergonomic precision of robotic technology and instrumentation with the established benefits of weight loss surgery. This study employs a bibliometric approach to identify local research trends and worldwide patterns in RMBS. Materials & Methods: The research methodology used “robotic” and “metabolic” or “bariatric surgery” to search Web of Science. Articles that were published prior to December 31st, 2023, were included. The analyses were developed using the Rayyan and Bibliometric, in R Studio. Results: 265 articles from 51 different journals were included. Scientific production of RMBS experienced a significant annual growth rate of 21.96% from 2003 to 2023, resulting in an average of 12.6 papers published per year. A high correlation (R2 = 0.94) was found between the year and number of articles. The mean number of citations per document was 13.25. Approximately 90% of the journals were classified as zone 3, according to the Bradford categorization. International collaboration was identified in 10.57% of cases, with the University of California and the University of Illinois being the most common organizations. The countries with the highest number of corresponding authors, in descending order, were the United States of America, China, and Switzerland. Conclusion: Scientific production in RMBS has experienced sustained growth since the first original publications in 2003. While it has not yet reached the volume, impact, and international collaboration seen in studies related to non-robotic metabolic and bariatric surgery, RBMS holds potential that remains to be explored.

AB  - Biomass-based hydrogen production is an innovative approach for realizing carbon-neutral energy solutions. Despite their promise, both structures differ in terms of the biomass energy domain, which is at the entry point of the technology, and the hydrogen energy domain, which is at the exit point of the technology. In this study, we conducted structural and predictive analyses via cross-domain bibliometric analysis to clarify the differences in the structures and perspectives of researchers across domains and to suggest ways to strengthen collaboration to promote innovation. Our study revealed that the hydrogen energy domain has a balanced impact on realizing a hydrogen society using biomass-based hydrogen production technology, while the biomass energy domain has a strong interest in the process of processing biomass. The results reveal that different communities have different ideas about research, resulting in a divide in the areas to be achieved. This comparative analysis reveals the importance of synergistic progress through interdisciplinary efforts. By filling these gaps, our findings can lead to the development of a roadmap for future research and policy development in renewable energy and highlight the importance of a unified approach to sustainable hydrogen production. The contribution of this study is to provide evidence for the importance of cross-disciplinary cooperation for R&D directors and policy makers. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Higher Education (HE) can play a fundamental role in the achievement of sustainable development, and particularly the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as captured in the Incheon declaration. However, what approach HE should take in this mission is a contested space. In this paper, we interrogate the idea of indigeneity. The pursuit to ascertain how an indigenised approach to internationalisation can support or enhance the contribution of HE curricula towards sustainable development is driven by the understanding that for sustainable development to be achieved at all, the process of knowledge creation must strive to make integral those epistemologies that exist beyond the “West”; an understanding that aligns, in particular, with Target 7 of the United Nations (UN) SDG 4 and seeks to empower victims of epistemic violence. In doing so, we employed a bibliographic research which captured a dual approach consisting of a bibliometric analysis of literature and a review of case studies. The findings from both methods suggest that internationalisation appears in different disciplinary contexts, but these are not always aligned with indigenisation. We maintain that the construct of (inter)culturality can address aspects within the framework of indigeneity to boost the internationalisation of HE curricula and outcomes for sustainable development. Central to this are four factors, namely: the need for effective human engagement with (inter)cultural competence, medium/place of curricula interaction, the initiative form and the reach of the development. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This study undertakes a bibliometric examination of the literature on supply chain sustainability (SCS). The analysis includes exploring co-authorship, examining keyword co-occurrences, conducting citation analysis, bibliographic coupling, co-citation analysis for performance evaluation, and employing science mapping techniques. The paper thus explores the significant facets of the literature on SCS. We studied the literature on SCS management from 1996 to 2024 and extracted 6898 articles retrieved from the Scopus database. In the preliminary phase, the investigation employs the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flow methodology alongside a designated search strategy. Secondly, it employs Biblioshiny, an RStudio package, and VOSviewer. The study finds that the SCS field has evolved with a major focus on collaboration, innovation, and sustainability. Furthermore, the findings indicate that China, the USA, the UK, and India lead in research contributions, emphasizing the importance of international collaboration. Additionally, the findings signpost that technology such as blockchain enhances sustainability efforts. Social sustainability also gains recognition alongside environmental concerns. These findings can inform researchers, highlighting the need for international cooperation, technology integration, and emphasis on social sustainability in advancing the management of supply chains. This study makes novel contributions by providing global coverage of publications, adopting an inclusive approach encompassing case studies and empirical research articles, addressing social desirability bias by reporting positive as well as negative aspects of sustainability in supply chain practices, and identifying alternative areas for future research within the discipline. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Searsia pentaphylla, known as sumac or Tizgha, is a comestible plant used to treat dermatological, genitourinary, and digestive diseases. This shrub is known also for its coloring properties due to its high tannin content. The pharmacological studies realized on Searsia pentaphylla revealed promising antioxidant activity, antifungal activity, antibacterial activity, anti-Alzheimer's disease activity, and vasorelaxant and antihypertensive activities. Additionally, this plant is widely utilized in traditional medicine in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Palestine, Italy, and Saudi Arabia. Our bibliometric analysis realized on Searsia pentaphylla (1932–2023) showed that there aren't sufficient studies on this plant and more studies are needed to explore its benefits and its promising therapeutic potential. © 2024

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated response measures have profoundly impacted both the environment and human life, posing significant challenges to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Several studies have utilized satellite remote sensing to evaluate COVID-19 impacts. In this study, a bibliometric analysis is conducted to reveal the research hotspots limiting to COVID-19 and remote sensing, and further to explore the impacts on SDGs. Results show that the TOP 3 countries of publication amounts are ranked as the United States, China, India. There is a wide range of collaboration in scientific research during this global pandemic, especially in Europe. The publication amounts of research related to SDG 11 are the most, followed by SDG 3, SDG 13, SDG 6, SDG 8, SDG 14, etc. The prevalent topics include the COVID-19 impacts on air quality, water quality, agriculture and food security, climate change, forest ecosystem, and socio-economy. This pandemic brought enormous losses to the socio-economy, which hinders the progress of SDG 8 and SDG 11.5, while had positive or negative effects on goals involving environment and ecosystem, such as SDG 2, SDG 6, SDG 11.6, SDG 13 and SDG 15. Generally, the impacts of COVID-19 on SDGs are comprehensive and systemic, and may depend on the local conditions and management capacity. With satellite remote sensing increasingly vital, global disaster risks can be monitored and managed more effectively to support SDGs in the future. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the past 3 decades, thyroid cancer research has surged, becoming the leading topic in clinical thyroidology. Despite this, there's a lack of data identifying key articles, authors, and journals. This study aims to provide insights for authors, physicians, and research labs by highlighting the most influential journals, authors, and research topics in thyroid cancer. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted using the Scopus database, employing the medical subject heading (MeSH) terms "Thyroid" and "Cancer" in the titles, abstracts, or keywords of articles. The search was limited to English articles in academic medicine journals published between January 1993 and December 2021. RESULTS: The search yielded 21 472 articles across 3076 journals, authored by 13 974 senior authors. The number of journals publishing on thyroid cancer expanded from 29 in 1993 to 733 in 2021, marking an average annual growth of 14%. Article output on the topic increased from 54 in the initial year to 1580 by 2021, with an annual growth rate of 16%. A thematic analysis revealed 369 articles mentioning "BRAF" since 2004, 479 articles on "ultrasound" techniques, 325 on "ablation" methods, and 453 articles focusing on "genetics" in thyroid cancer. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism emerged as the most prolific, publishing 1017 articles over the 29-year period. CONCLUSION: This study guides resource allocation towards impactful journals for thyroid cancer researchers, helps identify key contributors for collaboration or mentorship, and provides a framework for similar analyses in other fields.

AB  - Local content policies (LCPs) aim to create opportunities for employment and economic development, and to shield from the “resource curse” and enclave extractivism. LCPs are of ongoing policy interest in resource-rich countries and, more recently, have attracted attention in countries attempting to develop their renewable energy sources. The sustainable development agenda set by the global and regional initiatives, such as the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement, call for a fresh look at the targets and priorities set by LCPs, e.g., extend to environmental and/or climate change action targets. This article aims to connect in a meaningful way the scientific knowledge on LCPs and evidence-based policy making with the sustainability agenda imperatives. The target is met with the: i) completion of a systematic state-of-the-art literature review and bibliometric analysis to assess and synthesize the accumulated stock of knowledge on LCPs and ii) SDGs mapping onto the LCPs. Τhe review identifies the core approaches and LCPs' assessment outcomes, indicating the plethora of findings. Results show that the relationship between LCPs and the sustainability agenda has not yet been properly analyzed in the literature, identifying thus a gap between research and contemporary policy making. The research community should be proactive: rather than just assessing LCPs' implementation, it should propose alternatives and updates to LCPs in line with the sustainability agenda. The article contributes to this direction by mapping the SDGs onto the LCPs, suggesting ways to advance research in this field and to support evidence-based policy making. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: There is a growing interest in utilizing a combination of brain radiotherapy (RT) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for patients diagnosed with brain metastases (BM) in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma (LAC). The current status of this treatment strategy remains a subject of debate. Methods: We initiated our study by conducting a comprehensive literature search using the SCI-expanded database of Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). We utilized the VOSPviewer software to analyze various aspects of the research, including the year of publication, authorship, keywords, and country.Subsequently, we performed an extensive and systematic literature search on popular online databases. Our primary outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS), both quantified by hazard ratios (HRs). Additionally, for data verification, we included data from patients in non-small cell lung cancer with brain metastasis who underwent therapeutic intervention at the Cancer Prevention and Treatment Center of Sun Yat-sen University and the Radiotherapy Department of Hanzhong Central Hospital between August 2012 and November 2021. Results: The bibliometric analysis revealed an increasing trend in research focused on the combination of RT and TKIs for the management of lung cancer brain metastases over the previous decade. Then, nine studies consistent with the research direction were included for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that the OS (HR = 0.81, 95% confidence interval: 0.69–0.94; P = 0.007) and iPFS (HR = 0.71, 95% confidence interval: 0.61–0.82; P < 0.001) of the combination therapy were significantly prolonged. Finally, 168 EGFR-mutated BM advanced LAC patients in the real world were verified, and the median iPFS of the combination therapy (n = 88 and EGFR-TKIs alone (n = 80) were 16.0 and 9.0 months, respectively, (P < 0.001). The median OS was 29.0 and 27.0 months, respectively, with no dramatic difference (P = 0.188). Conclusions: Research on EGFR-mutant LAC brain metastasis has turned towards exploring optimal treatment strategies for this condition. Our meta-analysis and real-world data analysis consistently demonstrate that combination therapy offers a substantial improvement in patient survival compared to EGFR-TKI monotherapy. Notably, among patients undergoing salvage radiotherapy (RT), our subgroup analysis reveals that those initially treated with third-generation TKIs experience more significant benefits than those treated with first- or second-generation TKIs. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This study investigates the interconnectedness of Digital Sustainability (DS) and Corporate Digital Responsibility (CDR), through a dual-track systematic literature review, analyzing 202 scholarly works from Web of Science and Scopus. The review is based both on bibliometric and content analyses in order to map current knowledge on these two theoretical constructs. By collecting and comparing definitions and key topics, the review revealed that DS and CDR are treated separately in the current literature, missing their potential synergies—DS often overlooks ethical implications, while CDR neglects broader sustainability impacts. However, notable convergences emerged, leading to the development of an integrated Corporate Digital Sustainability (CDS) framework. This framework leverages digital technologies as a cross-cutting enabler and systematizes values, objectives, dimensions, practices, and aspects to guide corporations in navigating the complexities of digital sustainability while achieving responsible digital progress. The study concludes by proposing a research agenda to guide future explorations in this promising direction. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Live tissue training (LTT), use of a living anaesthetized animal to practice surgical skills, is a continuing practice, despite controversy and ethical concern. The scientific literature appears polarized in terms of supporting or refuting the practice. This bibliometric analysis of the literature maps and explores the academic conversation regarding LTT including potential influences associated with authorship. METHOD: Literature identified via the process conducted during a previously published systematic review was used for analysis. 84 literature sources were included. Bibliometric data were manually extracted for analysis, and visually mapped. RESULTS: The scientific conversation about LTT use in trauma is centered on surgery, trauma and emergency medicine specialties, published in clinical journals, with significant influence noted from military authors and organizations. Few authors published work in simulation or education-based journals. Publications are considered to be generally supportive of, or ambivalent to, the use of LTT; those with notable objections to LTT tended to be affiliated to animal activist organizations. CONCLUSION: There is academic conversation apparent within the literature, in the form of citations, although this is used to affirm or rebuke a given perspective, rather than engage with, or learn from, the content. There is potential benefit to increased interactivity between researchers. The conversation could also be informed by authors broadening the outlook to wider medical educational literature and other disciplines, rather than focusing on application to clinical training, to improve trauma education for all, regardless of modality. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - This study introduces a clustering framework that effectively evaluate scholars’ publication performance by utilizing cluster analysis and bibliometric data. In order to capture the various aspects of scholars’ publication characteristics, our proposed framework integrates four distinct features, namely “APIR” which represents Academic age, Productivity, Impact, and Recency. The proposed framework is implemented in a case study focusing on Turkish academia, utilizing a dataset comprising 13,070 scholars from 24 diverse academic divisions across 30 Turkish universities. Cluster analysis yields seven groups of scholars with diverse publishing characteristic based on APIR features and these obtained clusters are profiled as “freshmen”, “stagnant impactful mids”, “rising stars”, “stagnant and non-prolific juniors”, “stagnant impactful seniors”, “super stars”, “currently active and prolific seniors”. To enhance the cluster analysis results, additional cross analysis is performed based on scholars’ certain demographics such as affiliating institutes, divisions, academic titles, and PhD qualification. Scholars in clusters with superior publication performance are often affiliated with top-ranked universities and have academic backgrounds in the fields of Medicine, Engineering, and Natural Sciences. Practically, generated scholar segments and analysis based on these scholar profiles can serve as useful input for policy makers during having decisions about recruitment, promotion, awarding and allocation of funds. © 2024

AB  - This study investigates the influence of a magnetic field on the flame characteristics of waste cooking oil. A circular current-carrying coil was used to generate magnetic fields of varying strengths (131.37 G, 234.19 G, 337.07 G, 394.12 G, and 428.39 G), corresponding to different voltages (0–10 V). Flame behavior was captured with a digital camera, both without a magnetic field and under varying field strengths. Flame height and area were analyzed using ImageJ and MATLAB's Image Processing tools. Additionally, the thermal properties and fatty acid composition of the waste cooking oil were examined. Results indicated that the flame height increased by 11.06 % under the strongest magnetic field compared to the baseline. The flame area initially expanded due to magnetically induced diffusion but later decreased as the flame stabilized and turbulence reduced. A strong correlation was found between the flame area estimations from ImageJ and MATLAB. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: Renal Denervation (RDN) is a novel non-pharmacological technique to treat hypertension. This technique lowers blood pressure by blocking the sympathetic nerve fibers around the renal artery, then causing a decrease in system sympathetic nerve excitability. This study aimed to visualize and analyze research hotspots and development trends in the field of RDN for hypertension through bibliometric analysis. Methods: In total, 1479 studies were retrieved on the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database from 2004 to 2023. Using CiteSpace (6.2.R4) and VOSviewer (1.6.18), visualization maps were generated by relevant literature in the field of RDN for hypertension to demonstrate the research status and frontiers. Results: The number of publications was found to be generally increasing. Europe and the United States were the first countries to carry out research on different techniques and related RDN clinical trials. The efficacy and safety of RDN have been repeatedly verified and gained increasing attention. The study involves multiple disciplines, including the cardiovascular system, peripheral vascular disease, and physiological pathology, among others. Research hotspots focus on elucidating the mechanism of RDN in the treatment of hypertension and the advantages of RDN in appliance therapy. Additionally, the research frontiers include improvement of RDN instruments and techniques, as well as exploration of the therapeutic effects of RDN in diseases with increased sympathetic nerve activity. Conclusion: The research hotspots and frontiers reflect the status and development trend of RDN in hypertension. In the future, it is necessary to strengthen international collaboration and cooperation, conduct long-term clinical studies with a large sample size, and continuously improve RDN technology and devices. These measures will provide new options for more patients with hypertension, thereby improving their quality of life. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Objective: Bibliometrics was employed in this study to determine the research trends in the worldwide application of 3D printing technology to treat bone tumors over the previous 10 years. Methods: Published from 2013 to 2022, the papers related to bone tumors treated with 3D printing were located in Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), PubMed, and Scopus. The screened articles were included in this bibliometric study. From these papers in WoSCC, information on annual publications, journals, keywords, countries, authors, institutions, and cited references were extracted and visualized with CiteSpace (version 6.1.R6) software to investigate the state of bone tumor treatment using 3D printing as well as research hotspots. The Carrot2 online visualization tool and Vosviewer software (version 1.6.20) were employed to visualize the publications from PubMed and Scopus, respectively, in order to ascertain the most popular research topics from both databases. Results: A total of 606, 233, and 364 publications were obtained from WoSCC, PubMed, and Scopus, respectively, between the years 2013 and 2022. In WoSCC, the peak number of publications was found in 2021, with 145 publications published. Acta Biomaterialia (11 publications) and World Neurosurgery (10 publications) were the most prolific journals, and Biomaterials was the journal cited the most (244 times). Yong Zhou was the most productive author with 14 publications, while Kwok-Chuen Wong (69 citations) and William F Enneking, (69 citations) possessed the most citations. The country with the largest quantity of publications was China (207). Among all institutions, Shanghai Jiao Tong University produced the most publications (29). Rapid prototyping was the keyword with the strongest citation burst (4.73). ‘Reconstruction’, ‘surgery’, ‘resection’, and ‘design’ caught the significant attention of researchers. 3D-printed materials, pelvic reconstruction, mandibular reconstruction, computer-assisted surgical techniques, photothermal therapy, and in vitro experiments were recognized as hot subjects and trends in current research. The most frequently occurring topics in Scopus are not significantly different from those found in WoSCC. The most prevalent research areas in PubMed encompass implant, patient-specific, bioceramic, models, and pelvic. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Plug Flow Reactors (PFRs) are widely recognized for their cost-effectiveness due to lower initial investments and start-up expenses in comparison to alternative systems. However, PFR face substantial challenges, including inadequate mixing leading to low mass transfer, potential issues related to thermal stratification, and complications arising from solid sedimentation. Furthermore, concerns related to floating, or scum formation highlight their limitations in diverse industrial applications. Recent years have witnessed significant progress in both research and industrial development pertaining to PFRs. This progress primarily focuses on improving PFR performance through innovative reactor design, optimized operating conditions and enhanced mixing. This review provides an extensive overview of these advancements, as identified through bibliometric analysis and literature review. The review delves into various retrofitting approaches for PFRs, exploring their impact on digester stability and methane production. Finally, the authors adopted a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to compare, from a practical/industrial perspective, mixed PFR systems with internal moving parts to those without. The evaluation relies on two criteria categories: technical and economic. The results revealed that mixing without internal moving parts excels in energy efficiency, reduced maintenance, lower contamination risks, and simpler design. Recommendations for future work are provided accordingly. © 2024

AB  - Objective: To conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in Rare diseases (RDs), with a focus on analyzing publication output, identifying leading contributors by country, assessing the extent of international collaboration, tracking the emergence of research hotspots, and detecting trends through keyword bursts. Methods: In this bibliometric study, we identified and retrieved publications on AI applications in RDs spanning 2003 to 2023 from the Web of Science (WoS). We conducted a global research landscape analysis and utilized CiteSpace to perform keyword clustering and burst detection in this field. Results: A total of 1501 publications were included in this study. The evolution of AI applications in RDs progressed through three stages: the start-up period (2003–2010), the steady development period (2011–2018), and the accelerated growth period (2019–2023), reflecting this field’s increasing importance and impact at the time of the study. These studies originated from 85 countries, with the United States as the leading contributor. “Mutation”, “Diagnosis”, and “Management” were the top three keywords with high frequency. Keyword clustering analysis identified gene identification, effective management, and personalized treatment as three primary research areas of AI applications in RDs. Furthermore, the keyword burst detection indicated a growing interest in the areas of “biomarker”, “predictive model”, and “data mining”, highlighting their potential to shape future research directions. Conclusions: Over two decades, research on the AI applications in RDs has made remarkable progress and shown promising results in the development. Advancing international transboundary cooperation is essential moving forward. Utilizing AI will play a more crucial role across the spectrum of RDs management, encompassing rapid diagnosis, personalized treatment, drug development, data integration and sharing, and continuous monitoring and care. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Many of the energy systems functioning across the developing world are poorly designed and largely inadequate to meet a country's commercial and domestic energy needs. This is especially so in Latin America, where poverty trends have been exacerbated by limited access to energy, which could be used towards supporting industrial and small-scale commercial activities. This has characterised the widespread trend of energy poverty. This phenomenon poses a major barrier towards achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and addressing climate change, since lack of access to reliable energy generation systems hinders the development of economic activities and limits the comfort of living conditions. This paper reports on a study aimed at catering to a better understanding of the challenges related to energy poverty in Latin America and identifying some of the tools that may be deployed to address them. The methodological procedures used were bibliometric analysis and survey. The main findings of this research evidence that reducing energy poverty in Latin American countries is crucial to alleviating household costs since a considerable part of family income is used to pay the energy needs. Less use of coal, greater access to electricity—including those from renewable generation—as well as the use of technologies and programs subsidized by governments would significantly contribute to increasing the Latin American citizens' quality of life and achieving the SDGs. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Master’s degree-level graduates in Subject Teaching (Geography) (hereinafter referred to as STG) in Chinese normal universities form a valuable pool of pre-service secondary school geography teachers. These graduates provide a comprehensive picture of the quality, focus and outcomes of current geography teacher training programs. However, there is a relative dearth of research appertaining to their research capabilities and the quality of their educational development. To address this gap, the present study adopts bibliometric and comparative analysis to shed light on the overall trends and specific characteristics of STG master’s theses from 2016 to 2022. The findings indicate that universities with divergent levels of subject assessment prioritize different research emphases, leading to variations in the depth of investigation into new teaching materials and the level of alignment with frontline geography teaching. Furthermore, in comparison with cutting-edge international and domestic research, the master’s theses of STG students are characterized by microscopic scale and insufficient depth. A three-pronged collaborative framework has therefore been advocated with the aim of enhancing the quality of STG graduates as pre-service geography teachers. This comprises close interactions among on-campus and off-campus tutors and learners, a partnership between universities and secondary schools, and inter-university cooperation. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The development of reinforcement learning (RL) provides innovative solutions for various decision-making problems in transportation, often pertaining to integrating advanced vehicular technologies such as connected and autonomous vehicles and electric vehicles. This paper reviews transportation research with RL-based methods over the recent decades. We start with a bibliometric analysis through extensive literature retrieval of 1030 papers from 1996 to 2023. We identify different research areas of RL in transportation, summarizing the most visited research problems. We find that, at the vehicle level, motion and route planning and energy-efficient driving problems have attracted the most attention. Meanwhile, adaptive traffic signal control and management have been the most visited problems at the network level. We discuss several potential future directions, including the migration of RL models from simulations to real-world cases, designing tailored control architectures for complex transportation systems, exploring explainable RL in transportation research to ensure transparency and accountability in decision-making processes, and integrating people and vehicles into transportation systems in a sustainable and equitable manner. © 2024

AB  - Background: Breast cancer (BC) remains the most commonly malignancy among women worldwide. Although early-stage BC typically presents with curative possibilities, advanced-stage disease, especially with metastasis, is significantly limited in terms of effective therapeutic interventions, thereby establishing it as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Antibody–Drug Conjugates (ADCs) establish a groundbreaking class of anti-neoplastic agents characterized by high specificity and targeting precision. These agents have been significant in reshaping the therapeutic approach to breast cancer, especially those subtypes with overexpression of the Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2). Comprising monoclonal antibodies, cytotoxic payloads, and conjugative linkers, ADCs function by specifically targeting antigens on cancer cells, thereby facilitating the intracellular delivery of the toxic payload. The present investigation endeavors to synthesize existing primary research outcomes through rigorous bibliometric and data analytical approaches, thereby elucidating the current research landscape, delineating research foci, and identifying potential avenues for future innovation. Methods: For bibliometric analysis, a comprehensive data set comprising 2181 entries related to ADCs in breast cancer was retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) spanning the years 1999 to 2023. This data was further filtered from the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-Expanded). Analysis software tools such as CiteSpace and VOSviewer were employed for multifaceted analyses such as trends of publications, contributions of countries, and burst analytics. In the dimension of clinical trials, we interrogated databases including ClinicalTrials.gov (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (https://trialsearch.who.int). A total of 239 clinical trials were initially sourced, among which, 175 were from ClinicalTrials.gov and 64 from ICTRP. After repetitive and correlation-based screening, 119 trials specifically addressing ADC therapeutic strategies in breast cancer were included. Analytical algorithms were executed using Microsoft-based software to evaluate treatment paradigms, emergent research themes, and progress. Results: Our investigations signify a growing trend of research on ADCs, with consistent advancements in scientific achievements. The analysis revealed that variables such as economic stratification of nations, healthcare investment paradigms, and disease incidence rates serve as significant determinants in shaping research output. Geographically, the United States emerged as the predominant contributor to the research corpus (36.56%), closely followed by China (21.33%). The underpinning of research accomplishments was found to be significantly bolstered by advancements in molecular biology, immunology, and genetic research. Moreover, the advent of nuclear magnetic resonance diagnostic modalities has contributed saliently to the diagnostic and therapeutic management of breast cancer. Conclusion: Our study provides a comprehensive overview of the ADC research landscape through rigorous bibliometric and clinical trial evaluations. At present, the ADC arena has witnessed the successful development and FDA approval of 14 distinct agents, substantially improving the clinical outcomes for a broad spectrum of oncological patients. Future research imperatives may include the exploration of ADCs targeting mutated oncoproteins, dual-specificity ADCs, combination payload strategies, peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs), and non-internalizing ADC modalities. With sustained academic and clinical focus, the ADC domain is poised for transformative advancements in targeted therapeutics across a variety of malignancies. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Mobility inequality is prevalent in different levels of severity in most of the development occurring worldwide. The rapid expansion of research on this topic in the last few decades has compelled scholars to comprehensively review the relevant literature. However, a bibliometric understanding of this field has not yet been conducted. We performed a bibliometric analysis of 578 articles on the subject published between 2002 and 2023, retrieved from the Web of Science, to identify and review the most influential literature. Descriptive and network analysis was carried out using Bibliometrix and VOSviewer software. Insights were derived regarding the most prominent authors, sources, countries, and keywords. Future research directions on mobility inequality are also proposed. We found that accessibility is a significant research cluster in mobility inequality research and has enough potential for further development. Further, a content analysis of 48 relevant articles under the accessibility cluster was conducted. Our study is limited to a bibliometric overview and a review of key literature and does not provide an in-depth review of the whole literature. However, it can aid scholars in understanding the trends and patterns of research development on mobility inequality and in identifying research gaps and future research themes. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - The increasing popularity of the Bayesian approach in Psychology has prompted metascientific efforts to quantify its prevalence. However, despite enduring debates between proponents of Frequentist and Bayesian schools of thought, no systematic comparison of their prominence has been conducted in existing literature. This brief report fills this gap, examining Bayesian and Frequentist trends in the period from 1964 to 2023 through a meticulous search in PsycINFO. The findings reveal that the Frequentist approach has consistently been more popular than the Bayesian approach in the realm of Psychometrics and Statistical Psychology. However, Bayesian contributions steadily increased from the 80’s onward and appear to be almost as important or even surpassing the Frequentist counterparts in the latest years investigated (2019–2023). Although this observation applies primarily to specialized literature rather than the entire domain of Psychology, it underscores the growing prevalence of the Bayesian approach, signaling attention among specialists in the field. © The Author(s) 2024.

Methods: The Web of Science core collection database was used to search the literature on PM2.5 and ischemic stroke from 2006 to 2024. Visualization analysis was conducted using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and an online bibliometric platform. Results: The analysis comprises 190 articles published between 2006 and 2024 by 1229 authors from 435 institutions in 39 countries, across 78 journals. Wellenius GA has the highest number of published and cited papers. China has the highest number of papers, while Canada has the highest citation frequency. Capital Medical University published the highest number of papers, and Harvard University had the highest citation frequency for a single paper. The study investigated the impact of PM2.5 on ischemic stroke in three phases. The first phase analysed hospitalisation rates for correlations. The second phase utilised large-scale multi-cohort data from around the world. The third phase involved studying global exposure risk through machine learning and model construction. Currently, there is limited research on the mechanisms involved, and further in-depth investigation is required. Conclusion: This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of the research framework and hotspots concerning the effect of PM2.5 on ischemic stroke. The analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of this field for researchers. It is expected that research on the effect of PM2.5 on ischemic stroke will remain an important research topic in the future. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Biofloc technology (BFT) has been identified as an effective and sustainable aquaculture method, particularly beneficial for warm-water species in tropical areas. This technology is widely used in intensive aquaculture for several aquatic species due to its capacity to significantly reduce water exchange rates, benefiting both production systems and the environment. The efficacy of BFT in farming operations is directly related to a proper management of water quality parameters within the optimal range of the target species, as these parameters directly impact the yield of production units. Essentially, BFT functions as a water quality management system, converting harmful nitrogenous waste such as ammonia and nitrite into less harmful forms such as nitrates through microbial activity, ensuring the health of aquatic organisms. Key environmental factors such as temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, salinity, alkalinity, TAN, nitrite, nitrate, settleable solids (SS), and total suspended solids (TSS) can affect the growth of aquatic species and the functionality of the microbial community. This review brings (i) a comprehensive bibliometric analysis on biofloc and water quality, (ii) highlights optimal ranges, and (iii) key observations of several water parameters including temperature, salinity, nitrogenous compounds, SS, TSS, DO, phosphate, pH, and alkalinity in BFT rearing conditions for key aquatic species. Elements such as countries, thematic and keywords, and authors were explored, correlated, and discussed. In addition, this manuscript also (iv) discusses the presence of heavy metals and microplastics (MPs) in BFT culture water. A dedicated review on water quality in biofloc technology will contribute to future research and development (R&D) in this topic, support decision-making to improve farming operations, and can help further expansion of BFT-based aquaculture. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Background: Childhood cancer rates in Africa are lower than in high-income countries but increasing, making pediatric cancers a significant public health concern. The purpose of this study was to provide an overview of the publication of pediatric cancer research in Africa, including publication types and citation trends over time. Methods: The Science Citation Index Expanded database within the Web of Science Core Collection was searched for articles published from 1991 to 2022 in the topic domain, using title, abstract, author keywords, and KeyWords Plus. Indicators used to assess publications performance of the countries included: total number of publications, single-country publications, collaborative publications with African countries, collaborative publications with non-African countries, first-author publications, corresponding-author publications, and single-author publications. Results: A total of 4461 relevant documents were retrieved, with 2770 original research articles. Annual number of articles rose from 13 articles in 1991 to 287 in 2022. Most articles were produced by Egypt (28 %) in North Africa, followed by South Africa (20 %) in sub-Saharan Africa. Collaboration between African countries remains low; however, international collaborations have enhanced the average number of citations per article. Most of the first authors (65 %) and corresponding authors (67 %) of these international collaborative articles were affiliated with non-African institutions. Conclusions: The number of publications sharply increased over the study period and diversely represents African countries. Collaborations with international partners increased citations; however, few of these publications had African first authors. Conversely, inter-institutional partnerships between African countries were relatively low, highlighting the need for better collaboration within Africa. © 2024 Pediatric Hematology Oncology Chapter of Indian Academy of Pediatrics

AB  - Outcome-based education (OBE) is a method of educational approach that focuses on defining specific learning outcomes or objectives that students should achieve by the end of a course, program, or educational experience Instead of merely following a predetermined curriculum, OBE places focus on what learners should be able to accomplish or display as a result of their learning. A thorough bibliometric analysis utilizing biblioshiny and VOSviewer is used in this work to dive into the world of outcome-based education. This investigation attempts to offer quantitative insights into the development, trends, and significant contributors in the area of OBE by carefully examining a wide range of academic articles. The study encompasses a broad temporal range, capturing developments in the field from its inception in 1978 to 2023, thereby offering a comprehensive overview of its evolution over time. Patterns in research production, significant works, prolific authors, and collaboration networks appear via the prism of bibliometric approaches, illuminating the complex OBE landscape. This study not only contributes to the understanding of OBE’s scholarly landscape but also underscores the significance of bibliometric approaches in illuminating trends and shaping future research directions. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - Digital equity is imperative for realizing the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG9 and SDG10. Recent empirical studies indicate that Design for Digital Equity (DDE) is an effective strategy for achieving digital equity. However, before this review, the overall academic landscape of DDE remained obscure, marked by substantial knowledge gaps. This review employs a rigorous bibliometric methodology to analyze 1705 DDE-related publications, aiming to delineate DDE’s research progress and intellectual structure and identify research opportunities. The retrieval strategy was formulated based on the PICo framework, with the process adhering to the PRISMA systematic review framework to ensure transparency and replicability of the research method. CiteSpace was utilized to visually present the analysis results, including co-occurrences of countries, institutions, authors, keywords, emerging trends, clustering, timeline analyses, and dual-map overlays of publications. The results reveal eight significant DDE clusters closely related to user-centered design, assistive technology, digital health, mobile devices, evidence-based practices, and independent living. A comprehensive intellectual structure of DDE was constructed based on the literature and research findings. The current research interest in DDE lies in evidence-based co-design practices, design issues in digital mental health, acceptance and humanization of digital technologies, digital design for visually impaired students, and intergenerational relationships. Future research opportunities are identified in DDE’s emotional, cultural, and fashion aspects; acceptance of multimodal, tangible, and natural interaction technologies; needs and preferences of marginalized groups in developing countries and among minority populations; and broader interdisciplinary research. This study unveils the multi-dimensional and inclusive nature of methodological, technological, and user issues in DDE research. These insights offer valuable guidance for policy-making, educational strategies, and the development of inclusive digital technologies, charting a clear direction for future research. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The construction industry has undergone a significant transformation with the advent of Industrial Digitalization 4.0, generating massive amounts of data across all phases of construction projects. This data explosion presents both opportunities and challenges for construction management in terms of effectively managing information and extracting valuable knowledge to support decision-making. In response to this challenge, the Bayesian approach has emerged as a powerful framework for addressing the complexities and uncertainties inherent in construction projects. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the development and applications of Bayesian approaches in construction management. Based on a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) systematic review methodology and supported by objective analytics techniques and digital tools, the study delineates the conceptual and methodological evolution from 1988 to 2023 of four primary Bayesian approaches: estimation-inference, modeling, simulation, and classification. The review synthesizes the advantages, limitations, and challenges associated with these approaches, highlighting their potential to incorporate prior knowledge, update beliefs based on new evidence, and model complex relationships among variables. The findings reveal a mature and diverse research landscape, with Bayesian methods being leveraged to improve decision-making across various stages and aspects of construction projects. As the construction industry continues to embrace digital transformation and data-driven approaches, the integration of Bayesian methods with emerging technologies and practices is likely to open up new opportunities for enhanced decision support and project success. This study provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to leverage the power of Bayesian approaches in construction management. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Many authors have described ‘urban ecology’ as a subfield of ecology that emerged in the 1990s and has expanded exponentially. We propose to take a step further and analyse the expansion of the ‘urban’ in ecology with a novel quantitative approach, with the aim to better understand the relationship between ecology and the urban. Previous quantitative assessments of the urban in ecology have focused on short to medium time spans (5 to 40 years) and on research coined as ‘urban ecology’, and have rarely considered the content of publications (e.g., vocabulary and topics) using quantitative methods. In this paper, we conduct a bibliometric assessment and an in-depth quantitative textual data analysis of a corpus of 960 articles published from 1922 to 2018 in 10 leading English-language journals in ecology and conservation biology. We address the following questions: (1) When and how have urban environments been integrated into ecological research during the past century? (2) What urban research topics have been investigated in ecology during the same period? (3) How have these research topics changed through time? Our results show that the urban was never entirely absent from publications in ecology. The quantitative analyses highlight three turning points (1970s, 1990s and 2000s) in the relationship between ecology and the urban. Moreover, they help visualize the shift from particularly scattered publications at the beginning of the period to publications characterized by a more homogeneous vocabulary, reflecting the stabilization of a research field focused on the urban in ecology. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Higher education must evolve and adapt to technological changes in developing skilled human capital. Nevertheless, each technology has features that may eventually lead to user acceptance. This paper reviews factors that led to technology acceptance in the higher education context based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model since 2009. The related articles were extracted from the Scopus database. A screening process was performed to filter the related articles guided by the PRISMA approach. Specific keywords were used for searching, and 50 articles were identified. Only 44 related articles were reviewed after the identification and screening processes. Bibliometric analysis was used to understand further and highlight the impact of past studies and certain trends of their works that would benefit future research. The review revealed that performance expectancy is the most critical determinant that could affect users' intention to accept technology used in higher education institutions when the original UTAUT and its extended framework were used. However, all variables revealed some inconsistencies. Future studies should further investigate the reason behind this occurrence. Most of the past studies used covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) as a data analysis tool when dealing with a complex model. This paper provides insights to policymakers in the higher education sector that are useful for their capital investment decision-making in future technology developments. It triggers that any technology that will be put into practice needs to be efficient and have features that could improve individual performance in performing tasks. © 2024, Malque Publishing.

AB  - Hydrogels are formed of crosslinked polymer chains arranged in three-dimensional (3D) networks. These chains have good water-containing capacity and are soft and malleable. Hydrogels have good biocompatibility due to their significant water content, flexible structure, and numerous holes. These characteristics make them analogous to biological tissues. Despite the publication of 8700 literature related to hydrogel biomedical applications in the past 52 years (1973 ~ 2024), studies on the use of hydrogels in biomedicine are few. To gain a comprehensive understanding of their current development status, research trends, and prospects in the biomedical application field, it is imperative to conduct a thorough retrospective analysis. In this study, we employ bibliometric analysis and CiteSpace software to quantitatively and visually analyze articles published in this field. Firstly, we provide a quantitative analysis of authorship and institutional publications over the past 52 years to elucidate the fundamental development status regarding hydrogel biomedical applications. Secondly, we did visual studies on terms that are high-frequency, explosive, keyword clustering, and so on, to understand the directionality and evolution of the main research hotspots during each period. Notably, our findings emphasize that fabricating hydrogels into wound healing-promoting dressings emerges as a prominent hotspot within the application field. We anticipate that this paper will inspire researchers with novel ideas for advancing hydrogel applications in biomedicine. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The rapid expansion of information technology and the intensification of population aging are two prominent features of contemporary societal development. Investigating older adults’ acceptance and use of technology is key to facilitating their integration into an information-driven society. Given this context, the technology acceptance of older adults has emerged as a prioritized research topic, attracting widespread attention in the academic community. However, existing research remains fragmented and lacks a systematic framework. To address this gap, we employed bibliometric methods, utilizing the Web of Science Core Collection to conduct a comprehensive review of literature on older adults’ technology acceptance from 2013 to 2023. Utilizing VOSviewer and CiteSpace for data assessment and visualization, we created knowledge mappings of research on older adults’ technology acceptance. Our study employed multidimensional methods such as co-occurrence analysis, clustering, and burst analysis to: (1) reveal research dynamics, key journals, and domains in this field; (2) identify leading countries, their collaborative networks, and core research institutions and authors; (3) recognize the foundational knowledge system centered on theoretical model deepening, emerging technology applications, and research methods and evaluation, uncovering seminal literature and observing a shift from early theoretical and influential factor analyses to empirical studies focusing on individual factors and emerging technologies; (4) moreover, current research hotspots are primarily in the areas of factors influencing technology adoption, human-robot interaction experiences, mobile health management, and aging-in-place technology, highlighting the evolutionary context and quality distribution of research themes. Finally, we recommend that future research should deeply explore improvements in theoretical models, long-term usage, and user experience evaluation. Overall, this study presents a clear framework of existing research in the field of older adults’ technology acceptance, providing an important reference for future theoretical exploration and innovative applications. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Plastic pollution represents a global environmental issue. Awareness of plastic pollution in marine organisms increased strongly during the last decades, including chondrichthyans. Due to a lack of a broad and comprehensive view of this global issue in chondrichthyans, we synthesized the 48 publications covering 54 species since 2002, and employed bibliometric analysis and data exploration to summarize the historical progression of the development, characteristics of plastics in chondrichthyans and evaluate their potential impacts across various regions, habitats, and Red List categories. The bibliometric analysis revealed that the investigation of plastic distribution in demersal sharks inhabiting the nearshore areas of the Mediterranean and northeastern Atlantic Ocean is a major research focus. Based on the current evaluation, plastics have been ubiquitously discovered within sharks, skates, and rays; however, only less than 5% of chondrichthyans worldwide have been investigated. Among these, 25 species are classified under one of the three threatened categories (critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable), according to IUCN Red List. The average abundance (all specimens) and load (specimens that contained plastics) in chondrichthyans were 2.86 ± 7.71 items/individual and 4.91 ± 9.39 items/individual, respectively. Plastic abundance/load is not influenced by the sampling regions, habitats, or Red List categories; however, higher records were found in the endangered and near threatened species. The plastics are predominantly fibrous in shape, with blue and black being the predominant colors, along with polypropylene and polyethylene in polymer type. Notably, inconsistencies in sampling, processing, and identification methods across studies might impeded the integration and comparison of data. This review highlights the potential implications of plastic pollution from chondrichthyans on biodiversity conservation and emphasizes the necessity to consider intra- and inter-specific variations in biometric and ecological characteristics, as well as establish standardized protocols to facilitate effective comparisons in contamination dynamics between studies of chondrichthyans. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Background: Accrediting medical specialties programs are expected to influence and standardize training program quality, align curriculum with population needs, and improve learning environments. Despite global agreement on its necessity, methods vary widely. In the Chilean context, a recent new accreditation criteria includes research productivity in relation to educational research on resident programs, so we aimed to define it. What is the profile of publications in educational research produced by Chilean medical specialty residency programs in the last five years? Based on these results, we intend to analyze the potential impact of the new accreditation policy on medical specialty programs in Chile. Methods: We performed a preliminary bibliometric search to identify the use of the term “resident” in literature. After that, we conducted a literature search, using a six-step approach to scoping reviews, including the appraisal of the methodological quality of the articles. Results: Between 2019 and 2023, an average of 6.2 articles were published yearly (19%). The bibliometric analysis revealed that the dominant thematic area of the journals was clinical, accounting for 78.1%. Most articles focused on residents (84.38%), with only two articles including graduates as participants. One university was responsible for 62.50% of the articles and participated in all multicenter studies (9.38%). Surgical specialties produced 15 research articles focused on procedural training using simulation. Psychiatry was the second most productive specialty, with 5 articles (15.63%) covering standardized patients, well-being, and mental health assessment. The most frequent research focus within residency programs over the five-year period was teaching and learning methodologies, with 19 articles representing almost 60% of the total analyzed. Conclusions: Research on medical education in Chile’s postgraduate residency programs is limited, with most studies concentrated in a few universities. The new accreditation criteria emphasize educational research, posing challenges for many institutions to meet higher standards. Understanding unexplored areas in educational research and learning from successful programs can enhance research productivity and align efforts with accreditation expectations. Continuous evaluation and new research on residents’ satisfaction, skills acquisition, and well-being are needed to ensure training quality and accountability. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The world map is changing due to waves of immigration, population and demographic changes in mainland Europe and North America. There is a growing need for a more diverse teacher workforce to close the racial and ethnic gap between students and teachers in populations with high diversity. The scholarship discussing integration challenges facing teachers of colour and minority teachers in majoritarian education systems has yet to be exhaustively analysed and synthesised. Moreover, the literature remains fragmented despite numerous studies emphasising the significance of supporting teachers of colour and minority teachers to ensure equity and inclusiveness in majoritarian education systems to better represent the student body. This study reviews the literature through a bibliometric analysis of 387 peer-reviewed papers on this topic published between 2000 and 2024, followed by a synthesis of the top-cited papers. First, we emphasised the importance of researching the integration of minority teachers and teachers of colour to understand their contribution to students' thriving and the transformation of education systems towards diversity and inclusion. The quantitative analysis is followed by a systematic qualitative synthesis of the top 18 cited papers. The results highlighted that most research on minority teachers and teachers of colour is from the United States and the United Kingdom. They also highlighted the necessity of revisiting curriculums and enhancing relationships with children to raise awareness about issues of systemic racism, cultural responsiveness and deeper inclusion. Recommendations emphasise addressing systemic racism and enhancing cultural responsiveness. These findings can guide future research, policies and practices to support minority teachers' integration and better represent student diversity. Context and implications Rationale for this study The world map is changing due to waves of immigration, population shift, and demographic changes, highlighting the growing need for a more diverse teaching workforce to close the racial and ethnic gaps between students and teachers in highly diverse populations. However, the scholarship discussing the integration challenges faced by teachers of colour and minority teachers in majoritarian education systems remains fragmented and has yet to be exhaustively analysed and synthesised. Therefore, this paper presents a mixed-methods systematic review of recent international evidence on the integration of minority teachers and teachers of colour in majoritarian education systems worldwide. Why the new findings matter This research contributes to further insights in the scholarship foci, including identifying several research gaps related to the integration of teachers of colour and minority teachers. Our findings can inform future policies by enhancing understanding of the unique needs and challenges faced by minoritised teachers within various political, social and educational contexts. This knowledge can guide the training, recruitment, mentoring and retention of minority teachers. Additionally, further comparative research on this topic is necessary to enrich knowledge and contribute to diverse models for preparing, recruiting and retaining teachers of colour, thereby enhancing diversity in schools and fostering the success of minority students. Therefore, this study not only enriches our understanding of the current state of research but also sets the stage for future inquiries that could inform more nuanced and effective educational policies and practices worldwide. Implications for educational researchers and policy makers Our research findings offer valuable insights for scholars, policy makers, superintendents and school principals who are committed to conducting future empirical research, systematic reviews or implementing policies for the equitable inclusion of minoritised teachers in majoritarian education systems. These insights aim to promote deep diversity and representation. Key takeaways include: This systematic review identifies a research gap concerning the integration of teachers of colour and minority teachers. Addressing this gap involves understanding their unique needs and challenges within various political, social and educational contexts. There is a need for further comparative research on this topic to enhance knowledge and contribute to developing varied models for preparing, recruiting and retaining teachers of colour, thereby improving diversity in schools and supporting the success of minority students. Future policy design and implementation at both the district and school levels should focus on the training, recruitment, mentoring and retention of minority teachers. This includes identifying positive ecological dynamics at both district and school levels that support the integration of minority teachers and teachers of colour. In today‘s era of digital literacy and artificial intelligence (AI), we recommend researching the applicability, usage and impact of AI programs in enhancing equitable hiring processes. This research should explore how AI can be used to detect early warning signs of exclusion or marginalisation that may contribute to turnover among minority teachers, and how it can facilitate supportive interventions. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Metaheuristic algorithms have gradually become the mainstream way to solve complex optimization problems with their streamlined structure and robust performance. Innovative achievements have increasingly emerged with the development and widespread application of metaheuristic algorithms. In order to provide a better overview of relevant work in this field and clarify its prospects, this paper analyzed 1676 literature on the application of metaheuristic algorithms from 1994 to 2023, based on the Web of Science database. Firstly, utilizing a large amount of literature data, the overall trend of the application field development of metaheuristic algorithms, core authors, and mainstream journals was analyzed from the perspective of bibliometrics. Secondly, combined with the visualization software CiteSpace, major cooperation maps in the application field of metaheuristic algorithms were drawn, and the correlation relationships between authors, countries, and institutions in the area were obtained. Thirdly, co-word and cluster analyses were used to explore the research hotspots of applying metaheuristic algorithms, and six prevalent research topics in this field were obtained. Finally, through the co-cited literature cluster map and time-zone map, vital citing literature in the metaheuristic algorithms’ application field and the evolution of time-based development frontiers were summarized, and three development stages of this field were obtained. The overall review of the application of metaheuristic algorithms can provide assistance for researchers interested in this field. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Fipronil (FIP) is a broad-spectrum and highly efficient insecticide used against several arthropod pests, such as parasitic mites and insect pests affecting both animals and plants. Given its several benefits, FIP is widely used in the agricultural and veterinary medicine fields, but its indiscriminate use can have ecotoxic effects on non-target species. Thus, the current study aimed to summarise and critically analyse FIP's ecotoxicity in aquatic animals. Data referring to bibliometric parameters (publication year and geographical distribution), experimental conditions (field and laboratory, FIP type, animal class, species, habitat, and exposure conditions), and biomarkers (oxidative stress, DNA damage, neurotoxicity, and morphological changes) were summarised and critically analysed. Ecotoxicological studies were mainly conducted with insects, crustaceans, molluscs, and fish. Exposure to pure FIP or FIP-based commercial formulation can induce mortality and have sublethal effects on non-target organisms, such as increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative damage, genotoxicity (DNA damage), neurotoxicity, and morphological changes. The herein reviewed data have evidenced high median lethal FIP concentration (LC50) in vertebrates in comparison to invertebrates. The current findings confirmed that FIP can have several effects on aquatic organisms, besides suggesting potential ecotoxicological risks posed by this insecticide. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Environmental risk is one of the world's most significant threats, projected to be the leading risk over the next decade. It has garnered global attention due to increasingly severe environmental issues, such as climate change and ecosystem degradation. Research and technology on environmental risks are gradually developing, and the scope of environmental risk study is also expanding. Here, we developed a tailored bibliometric method, incorporating co-occurrence network analysis, cluster analysis, trend factor analysis, patent primary path analysis, and patent map methods, to explore the status, hotspots, and trends of environment risk research over the past three decades. According to the bibliometric results, the publications and patents related to environmental risk have reached explosive growth since 2018. The primary topics in environmental risk research mainly involve (a) ecotoxicology risk of emerging contaminants (ECs), (b) environmental risk induced by climate change, (c) air pollution and health risk assessment, (d) soil contamination and risk prevention, and (e) environmental risk of heavy metal. Recently, the hotspots of this field have shifted into artificial intelligence (AI) based techniques and environmental risk of climate change and ECs. More research is needed to assess ecological and health risk of ECs, to formulize mitigation and adaptation strategies for climate change risks, and to develop AI-based environmental risk assessment and control technology. This study provides the first comprehensive overview of recent advances in environmental risk research, suggesting future research directions based on current understanding and limitations. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The treatment of chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) involves a broad spectrum of therapies including many new and emerging techniques. To standardize the results of studies examining this pathology and to allow critical analysis and comparison between studies, the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) recommended reporting standard guidelines for the endovascular management of CLTI in 2016. Research studies that do not adhere to complete reporting standards are often more ambiguous in impact and external validity, leading to bias and misinformation that has potentially damaging effects on clinical decision-making. We thus sought to examine adherence to and factors associated with noncompliance with these recommended guidelines. Methods: A literature database search was conducted to include all clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, and retrospective comparative studies written in English examining the endovascular treatment of peripheral artery disease (PAD)/CLTI from January 2020 to August 2022. Systematic reviews, case reports, and meta-analysis were excluded. The manuscripts were reviewed for adherence with the SVS guidelines (overall and by guideline subcategories based on demographics, treatment methods, and outcomes), and factors associated with this adherence were determined. These data were used to calculate descriptive and comparative statistics. Results: Fifty-four manuscripts were identified from this time frame. On average, articles reviewed reported on 42.0% of the SVS reporting standards (range, 25.0–65.2%, Fig 1) with 74.1% of articles (n = 40) not adhering to at least 50.0% of the standards. Manuscripts most completely followed guidelines regarding “patient factors” and were least likely to demonstrate adherence to the description of CLTI and study complications. Within the guideline subcategories, complete adherence to guidelines was not demonstrated in any manuscript in stent trials, disease outcome measures, technical outcome measures, patient factors and critical limb ischemia description, and complete adherence rates within the other subcategories was low (range, 5.6–18.6%). Studies conducted within the United States and those with industry sponsorship were more likely to adhere to >50% of the reporting standards (P < 0.05). Journal impact factor, year of publication, and number of authors had no correlation to the percent adherence to guidelines in specific categories or adherence overall. Conclusions: Adherence to reporting standard guidelines for endovascular treatment of lower extremity PAD specifically outlined by the SVS is suboptimal regardless of the quality of the journal the research is published in. Increasing adherence to reporting standards to provide a framework for comparison of studies across techniques used should be prioritized by authors, journal editors, and vascular societies. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This work reviewed a large and fragmented body of academic and grey literature on water resources in Lebanon. The objective was to assess and curate the existing knowledge base that reflected the importance of water-related concerns. Studies were classified into four topics: water balance, quality, management and governance, each of which was subdivided into sub-topics. Bibliometric analysis was performed, the content was summarised and discussed, and future directions were proposed. In terms of water balance, precipitation requires more research, as available rainfall maps are outdated. Despite an increase in the number of weather stations, their spatial distribution and data continuity remain problematic. Snow cover area and duration differed among studies; thus, it also requires more research. Estimates of evapotranspiration lack comprehensive coverage and often focus on specific crops. Surface-water studies are rare and have low temporal resolution. River flows have high temporal and spatial variability, emphasizing the importance of groundwater, which is overexploited. No consistent trends in climate change impacts were detected. More research is needed in all of the hydrological cycle components. On the other hand, water quality is degrading rapidly with microbiological pollution in most rivers. Groundwater degradation, saltwater intrusion, nitrate pollution, and pesticide contamination pose significant challenges. In addition, emerging pollutants are also being detected. In terms of water management and governance, Lebanon's water framework is complex, involving many laws, institutions, and international partnerships. Despite reforms, challenges remain. Water management has evolved from being state-centred to having increased involvement by international organisations and the private sector. Access to public water networks has improved but remains intermittent. Wastewater networks are expanding, but treatment capacity remains limited. Finally, this work made it possible to quantify the research work and projects carried out in each Lebanese basin, which made it possible to identify gaps in study topics and areas. We hope that this work contributes to the ongoing debate about water security and serves as a resource to support water security and solutions for researchers, educators and policy makers. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is highly prevalent among males worldwide. The investigation of exosomes in PCa has emerged as a dynamic and important research area. To visually depict the prominent research areas and evolutionary patterns of exosomes in PCa, we performed a comprehensive analysis via bibliometric methods. Methods: Studies were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. CiteSpace, VOSviewers, and the R package “bibliometrix” were employed to analyze the relationships and collaborations among countries/regions, organizations, authors, journals, references, and keywords. Results: Over the past 20 years (2003–2022), 995 literatures on exosomes in PCa have been collected. The findings indicate a consistent upward trend in annual publications with the United States being the leading contributor. Cancers is widely recognized as the most prominent journal in this area. In total, 5936 authors have contributed to these publications, with Alicia Llorente being the most prolific. The primary keywords associated with research hotspots include “liquid biopsy”, “identification”, “growth”, “microRNAs”, and “tumor-derived exosomes”. Conclusion: Our analysis reveals that investigating the intrinsic mechanisms of exosomes in PCa pathogenesis and exploring the potential of exosomes as biomarkers of PCa constitute the principal focal points in this domain of research. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Objective: To conduct a bibliometric analysis of the prospects and obstacles associated with dual- and multi-energy CT in thoracic disease, emphasizing its current standing, advantages, and areas requiring attention. Methods: The Web of Science Core Collection was queried for relevant publications in dual- and multi-energy CT and thoracic applications without a limit on publication date or language. The Bibliometrix packages, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace were used for data analysis. Bibliometric techniques utilized were co-authorship analyses, trend topics, thematic map analyses, thematic evolution analyses, source’s production over time, corresponding author’s countries, and a treemap of authors’ keywords. Results: A total of 1992 publications and 7200 authors from 313 different sources were examined in this study. The first available document was published in November 1982, and the most cited article was cited 1200 times. Siemens AG in Germany emerged as the most prominent author affiliation, with a total of 221 published articles. The most represented scientific journals were the “European Radiology” (181 articles, h-index = 46), followed by the “European Journal of Radiology” (148 articles, h-index = 34). Most of the papers were from Germany, the USA, or China. Both the keyword and topic analyses showed the history of dual- and multi-energy CT and the evolution of its application hotspots in the chest. Conclusion: Our study illustrates the latest advances in dual- and multi-energy CT and its increasingly prominent applications in the chest, especially in lung parenchymal diseases and coronary artery diseases. Photon-counting CT and artificial intelligence will be the emerging hot technologies that continue to develop in the future. Critical relevance statement: This study aims to provide valuable insights into energy-based imaging in chest disease, validating the clinical application of multi-energy CT together with photon-counting CT and effectively increasing utilization in clinical practice. Key Points: Bibliometric analysis is fundamental to understanding the current and future state of dual- and multi-energy CT. Research trends and leading topics included coronary artery disease, pulmonary embolism, and radiation dose. All analyses indicate a growing interest in the use of energy-based imaging techniques for thoracic applications. Graphical Abstract: (Figure presented.) © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: Inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin 1β(IL1β), IL6,Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) can inhibit osteoblast differentiation and induce osteoblast apoptosis. PANoptosis, a newly identified type of programmed cell death (PCD), may be influenced by long noncoding RNA (lncRNAs) which play important roles in regulating inflammation. However, the potential role of lncRNAs in inflammation and PANoptosis during osteogenic differentiation remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the regulatory functions of lncRNAs in inflammation and apoptosis during osteogenic differentiation. Methods and results: High-throughput sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed genes involved in osteoblast differentiation under inflammatory conditions. Two lncRNAs associated with inflammation and PANoptosis during osteogenic differentiation were identified from sequencing data and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Their functionalities were analyzed using diverse bioinformatics methodologies, resulting in the construction of the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network. Among these, lncRNA (MIR17HG) showed a high correlation with PANoptosis. Bibliometric methods were employed to collect literature data on PANoptosis, and its components were inferred. PCR and Western Blotting experiments confirmed that lncRNA MIR17HG is related to PANoptosis in osteoblasts during inflammation. Conclusions: Our data suggest that TNF-α-induced inhibition of osteogenic differentiation and PANoptosis in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts is associated with MIR17HG. These findings highlight the critical role of MIR17HG in the interplay between inflammation, PANoptosis, and osteogenic differentiation, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for conditions involving impaired bone formation and inflammatory responses. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - In this bibliometric study, we used the Scopus database to analyse 2188 articles on leadership development in higher education published between 2013 and 2023. We examined publication output and research interest, preferred journals, leading countries, regions, authors, articles and institutions, subject areas and author keywords. Visualisation tools such as VOSviewer were used to gain a comprehensive understanding of patterns and trends in the literature. Recent studies have underscored the importance of leadership development in higher education, particularly in the context of evolving global educational standards (Day et al., (Day et al. in Leadersh Q 25:63–82, 2014); Žalėnienė & Pereira, (Žalėnienė and Pereira in Geography Sustain 2:99–106, 2021)). The results show a fluctuating increase in literature production since 2013, with a significant increase in production after 2020. This surge is attributed to the recognition that leadership is a key competency in shaping the future, especially in the face of the complexity and uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The study also shows that the United States is the most productive country, accounting for more than 50 percent of the total output of the 15 most productive countries. Notably, nine of the 15 most productive universities in these major countries are located in the United States. This highlights the important role that the United States plays in leading the global focus on leadership development in higher education. This study has important implications not only for academics, but also for policy makers, educators and leaders. Through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis, our aim is to contribute to the scholarly discourse on leadership development and higher education, and to encourage deeper discussion and continued innovation in these areas. Examining the development of leadership in higher education over the past decade provides valuable insights that inform research across various social domains. It contributes to a deeper understanding of the development of the field of leadership research in higher education over the past decade, highlighting key aspects of the field, contributors, research priorities and emerging trends. Our study contributes to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by enhancing understanding of leadership development in higher education (SDG 4: Quality Education) and fostering international collaboration (SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals) (in Transforming our world: the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, United Nations General Assembly, New York, 2015). © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Keeping up with the hastily growing economy implies undergoing unremitting transformation permanently. In the field of supply chain, such progress can only be guaranteed via the exploration of new horizons and innovative solutions in response to the constraints of the global market. Emerging technologies, particularly artificial intelligence, offer promising avenues for enhancing supply chain processes, with sustainability ascending as a critical consideration. Despite the recent surfacing of AI-driven applications, scant attention has been devoted to exploring their full potential within supply chain operations, particularly in conjunction with SDGs. Recognizing the untapped opportunities presented by the implementation of AI for a sustainable supply chain this study undertakes a bibliometric analysis of 236 research papers sourced from the Web of science database. The analysis utilizes R language BiblioShiny to examine the extracted papers, and dissect patterns, trends, and relationships among key concepts and themes as well as prominent topics, impactful authors, and leading journals and countries in this domain. The findings reveal substantial growth in research related to SCM, AI, and sustainability as the UK leads this field of study with 132 articles followed by India, China and the USA. Eventually, the National University of Singapore came first in terms of paper affiliations, followed by De La Salle University, and London Metropolitan University. These results only prove that sustainability is becoming more critical in the equation of AI-driven supply chains especially with the current socio-political and economic circumstances, constituting a solid base for further academic research and more innovations in the managerial and business-related policies in this field. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The emerging toxicants, N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine quinone (6PPD-Q), resulting from environmental exposure to N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD), have gained considerable attention owing to their ubiquitous occurrence and high toxicity. We performed a scientometric analysis on this topical area of research over the past two decades, spanning from 2004 to April 2024. The overarching aim was to reveal potential future directions in this research area, exploring several key aspects. These included publication and citation growth trends, relevant subject fields, distribution of contribution by country, influential journals in the field, keyword co-occurrence network and cluster analysis, and identification of top authors. The information was collected from the Scopus database and processed using the VOS viewer software. We observed a notable increase in the number of publications over the past four years. With a share of 46.2% of publications, “Environmental Sciences” dominated as the primary scientific category. Among all journals, “Science of the Total Environment” was the most prolific, publishing 33 documents, accounting for 15.6% of the total records. China, representing 76 publications (36%), followed by the United States, with 40 (18.9%), stood out as the leading countries. The occurrence of keywords such as “Pollution exposure”, “Mass spectrometry”, and “toxicity” highlighted the importance of assessing the toxicological properties, analytical methods, and environmental implications of these emerging contaminants to mitigate their adverse effects and protect environmental and human health. Cai, Zongwei from Hong Kong Baptist University was highly productive in this field, publishing 11 papers. Based on the bibliometric analysis presented, it seems that the future direction of research on 6PPD and 6PPD-Q will shift towards strategies focused on their removal and treatment. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Corporate information systems (IS) functions have become ever closer and more intertwined with firms' marketing functions. Marketing technology and e-commerce implementations require synergy between these functions, which has been reflected in the emergence of researchers and practitioners who can work at the intersection of these disciplines. This article utilizes a systematic literature review to understand this environment and to provide a forward-looking analysis of research at the intersection of IS and marketing. First, a business-focused introduction describes the motivation for the review and puts it into context. This is followed by a bibliographic analysis to select articles at this intersection. A semi-automated content analysis of the selected articles groups them into homogeneous research clusters and further analysis is used to develop cluster themes. This process sheds light on the potential areas of collaboration, offering an in-depth comprehension of their symbiotic relationship. A set of pathways for future research is described based on “collaboration areas” between IS and marketing. These areas, including consumer trust and decision making, social media, online reviews, mobile platforms & apps, and marketing channels, among others, represent the specific areas where marketing and IS overlap and mutually influence each other. Insights are presented on bridging academia and industry and suggestions are proposed for enhancing research at the junction of IS and marketing. © 2024

AB  - Introduction: Research on workplace safety has seen significant growth in academic and industry-focused literature over the past 20 years. However, the extant literature on workplace safety tends to focus on safety outcomes of physical accidents and injuries while relegating its conceptual and theoretical development to the background. Psychological safety and psychosocial safety climate in the workplace are essential to workers’ health and safety. These concepts are crucial in enabling job satisfaction, work engagement, and performance productivity. Progressing the literature on this subject is necessary to keep abreast with the changing dynamics of the post-COVID challenges, such as working from home, isolation, and stress from AI, among others. A significant gap in the extant literature burrows in the lack of conceptual clarity of workplace safety from a psychological perspective and the poor understanding of its substantive effects on organizations. Hence, re-examining workplace safety's conceptual and theoretical foundations from a psychological lens offers a more nuanced understanding of its potential to contribute to employee well-being and organizational resilience, pursuing a better work-life safe and more comfortable working environment. Method: This study: (a) synthesizes the theoretical propositions and empirical findings from 990 research articles published between 2000 and 2023 to map the existing body of knowledge about psychological safety and psychosocial safety climate, including their theoretical underpinnings and mechanisms, to offer a state-of-the-art overview of the scope of workplace occupational health and safety research from a psychological perspective; (b) applied a data-based research design adhering to PRISMA; (c) compiled descriptive synthesis and textual narrative syntheses through bibliometric analysis and a systematic literature review; and (d) opens the black box of workplace safety research by presenting significant findings to inform future conceptual, theoretical, and methodological research as well as the practice of workplace safety through the lens of psychology. Results: This study's findings further offer managerial implications to workplace safety policy-making and human resource management practices to enhance employees’ psychological safety and eliminate workplace psychosocial hazards. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - This research presents a clear overview of greenwashing practices in the food industry, along with instances in the academic literature. In this work, a bibliometric analysis covering over 711 articles from the Scopus database was carried out. According to the findings, research on greenwashing in general has expanded dramatically in the previous ten years, indicating an increasing importance for the upcoming years. While greenwashing is an established phenomenon in the food industry and an emerging topic among consumers, relatively few research papers are available on the subject; this review identified 16 papers that met the inclusion criteria. The review offers a detailed analysis of these papers. Key factors contributing to greenwashing practices in the food industry include advertising, access to information, transparency, knowledge, trust, and labelling. The review also identifies six major subtopics that significantly influence the food industry: retailers, corporate social responsibility, consumer research, food supply chain, and stakeholders. This study aims to serve as a valuable reference for policymakers and scholars who are determining the future path of greenwashing research. This review also aligns with the focus of the research agenda of several nations, and the EU, to act firmly against greenwashing practices and deceptive environmental claims. © 2024

AB  - Introduction: Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is associated with abnormal fundus neovascularization. Consequently, Anti-VEGF agents are vital for ophthalmic treatment. This paper reviews the application of anti-VEGF agents in ophthalmology over the past two decades with the aim of providing insights for further research. Methods: A meticulous search strategy was employed in the Web of Science Core Collection literature from 2003 to 2023 to gather relevant literature, which was then analyzed using VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and the R package Bibliometrix. Results: The study included 3,602 publications from 83 countries and 3,445 institutions. The United States and China have emerged as leading contributors in terms of the publication volume. Johns Hopkins University, the University of Sydney, and Genentech Inc were identified as frontrunners in this field. “Retina” had the highest publication volume, whereas “Ophthalmology” had the highest citation frequency. Among the 15,918 scholars, Bressler NM, Holz FG, Glassman AR, and Bandello F led in publication volume, while Brown DM was the most cited author. High-frequency keywords included “Endothelial Growth Factor,” “Therapy,” “Safety,” and “Randomized Clinical Trial.” Conclusion: Anti-VEGF drugs have shown notable success in treating neovascular eye diseases, especially wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema, focusing on clinical efficacy, injection regimens, and safety. Future directions include developing new anti-VEGF drugs, drug delivery systems, non-invasive administration, multi-target drugs, leveraging big data and artificial intelligence, and addressing the current treatment limits. Continuous innovation and method improvement in this field promise more breakthroughs, providing effective, safe, and economical options for eye disease treatment. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Cultural heritage visualisation research is a vast and constantly evolving field full of energy. It is concerned with the conservation, exhibition and education of cultural heritage. Plenty of studies have been reported, while more general bibliometric research is lacking. Thus, this study analyses, quantifies and maps the cultural heritage visualisation research from 1998 to 2023 using the Web of Science (WOS) core database. Biblioshiny was used to classify and evaluate the contributions of authors, countries, topics and journals. In addition, VOSviewer was used for the visual presentation of keywords. The results show that the hotspots of cultural heritage visualisation research are 3D modelling and digital management. Such techniques have become increasingly important and prevalent in the field of cultural heritage, with a multitude of activities. The study also makes predictions about how the future of cultural heritage visualisation will change, including a larger range of applications and cross-border collaboration across various disciplines. Therefore, this study provides a relatively new perspective through which more research directions can be found for the exploitation of cultural heritage conservation. © The Author(s) 2024.

Due to their characteristics, such as environmental persistence and bioaccumulation, ECs have severe and often hidden hazards, necessitating effective control measures. Membrane-based technologies possess satisfactory feasibility in the treatment of ECs, which are considered green, efficient, and economically beneficial. Membrane technologies such as membrane separation and membrane bioreactor (MBR) treatment can efficiently remove some ECs. With the rapid development of materials science, membrane-based coupled technologies such as catalytic membranes and adsorption membranes have also achieved significant success, offering effective solutions for the treatment of refractory organic contaminants. This article systematically elucidated the effectiveness, progress, and shortcomings of membrane-based technologies in the field of ECs treatment in recent years. The trends of membrane-based technologies in the field of removal of ECs in the past two decades were described in detail, with a bibliometric analysis. The management situation of newly discovered microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) was also discussed. This review provided reasonable insights into the application of membrane-based technologies in the removal of ECs and offers suggestions for future research directions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study explores the technological impact of chitosan research through patent citations, aiming to understand how academic work translates into technological innovation. Utilizing bibliometric techniques, we analyzed chitosan literature published during the period 2013–2022. Among the 67,751 scholarly outputs published during this period, 5.8 % have been cited in 7517 patents. The citing patents represent only 8.9 % of total chitosan patents filed, underscoring a significant proportion of patents not explicitly linked to recent chitosan-specific research. The findings highlight that while articles and reviews are the most impactful document types in terms of citability in patents, other document types also contribute, albeit to a lesser extent. Open access publications and those aligned with SDGs tend to be more frequently cited in patents. The study underscores the significant impact that publishing in higher-ranked journals has on the likelihood of research being cited in patents, while also acknowledging the substantial contribution of documents not assigned to any quartile. Patent analysis revealed chitosan's versatile properties and its widespread adoption across diverse technological and biomedical domains. This study constitutes the first report addressing the technological impact of chitosan research through patent citation. It provides insights into the factors that enhance the citability of chitosan research in patents, fostering further advancements in this multifaceted field. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Despite movements towards gender parity within academia, women faculty continue to be paid less than men. While previous research has explained the gap using academic rank/seniority and productivity, existing findings are limited by either their examination of base pay or reliance on self-reported data. Here we extend the analysis beyond base pay, link faculty salary records of one public university system in the U.S. to the OpenAlex bibliometric database, and separately analyze the gender pay gap in the base (grade) and other pay (off-grade). Using stepwise regression models, we find that faculty rank accounts for a significant gap in the base pay while performance-based variables such as H-index or specialization do not play a crucial role. For other pay, no variables stand out in explaining the substantial pay gap between women and men faculty. Our results suggest that a primary source of the remaining gender pay gap is the off-grade pay. Different policy approaches are required to reduce the gender pay gap depending on the specific type of salary being targeted. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Beneficial cannabis use has sparked growing interest among researchers, leading to an increase in empirical studies exploring its phytochemistry and applications. However, understanding the overall research orientation remains limited. This study aims to bridge this gap by conducting a bibliometric analysis of 7841 documents published from 2012 to 2022. The analysis reveals an annual growth rate of 16.83 %, with a focus on medicine, pharmacology, toxicology, pharmaceutics, biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, and neuroscience. Performance analysis highlights metrics of sources, countries, affiliations, and authors, while science mapping identifies keywords, thematic evolution, and citation/co-authorship patterns. Notably, Morocco, despite its limited initial contributions, has shown recent steady growth in cannabis research, with an annual growth rate of 14.31 % and a 51.72 % international collaborative rate. This study provides valuable insights into established fields and potential research directions in cannabis research, paving the way for a deeper understanding among the audience. With the changing legal status of cannabis, research is rapidly expanding, focusing on the plant's bioactive compounds, pharmacological properties, and therapeutic applications. The dominant subject areas are medicine, pharmacology, toxicology, pharmaceutics, biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, and neuroscience, covering nearly 76 % of the studied papers. Despite limited initial contributions from African countries like Morocco due to legal restrictions, beneficial cannabis research is gaining interest. Future research should prioritize in-depth exploration of specific compounds, comparative studies of cannabis-based products, and rigorous clinical trials. Fostering international collaborations and bridging the gap between research and policymakers are crucial for harnessing the full potential of cannabis while mitigating potential risks. This study serves as a reference for researchers to identify current orientations, blind areas, and gaps in cannabis research, offering suggestions for future studies. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Background: Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by Echinocccus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis and declared a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization. The disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in India, Australia, China, Turkey, South America, the Middle East, and Eastern European countries. Bibliometric analysis is a popular research trend that gains the advantage of evaluating all the studies about one specific topic and emphasizing the importance and place of the subject in the literature. With this study, we aim to evaluate all the global published literature in the Web of Science core collection database about urinary tract echinococcosis between 1945 and 2024. Methods: All documents indexed in the Web of Science core collection database between 1945 and 2024 were scanned on March 29, 2024. VOSviewer program 1.6.20 and MS Office Excel 2017 programs were used for forward analysis. Results: 152 documents were obtained, 102 of which were indexed in SCI-Expanded journals. Turkey (21.71%) was the leading country in terms of the total number of documents, followed by India (21.05%), but citations of Indian publications were higher (21.77%). Spain was in the first rank in terms of average citations per document (19.33). Most of the documents were original articles (78.29%). Okan Akhan was the most prolific author, with three documents. The most-cited document was conducted in 1997 by Angulo et al. and received 74 citations. With seven publications, Urology Case Reports was the journal that published the most documents on urinary tract echinococcosis. Conclusions: Evaluating the studies on urinary system echinococcosis with bibliometric analysis, it is understood that although the number of studies has gradually increased over the years, they are still less than expected. We recommend that more studies be conducted to determine the true prevalence of echinococcosis and ensure more effective management of the disease, especially in countries where it is endemic. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Nutritional supplements for sports and exercise (NSSE) can facilitate the exogenous replenishment of the body. This study provides the first extensive overview of NSSE research through bibliometric and visual analyses. Methods: We searched the Web of Science Core Collection database for literature related to “NSSE” from 1st January 2000 to 8th March 2024. A total of 1744 articles were included. CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Bibliometrix R package software were used to analyze the data. Results: Research in the NSSE can be divided into steady growth, exponential growth, fluctuating stage, and surge stages. The United States is the most active country in this field. In recent years, the leading countries have been Croatia, Colombia, Slovenia, Chile, Egypt, China, and Thailand. The Australian Institute of Sports is the top research institution in terms of number of publications. Burke, LM from Australia published the most articles. Research in this area has primarily been published in Nutrients in Switzerland. The study population mainly consisted of men, and postmenopausal women were the main focus of the female group. Coronary heart and cardiovascular diseases continue to dominate research. Conclusion: Research on the NSSE is developing rapidly, with an annual growth trend. Insulin resistance, sports nutrition, inflammation, alpha-linolenic acid, limb strength performance, female sex, and gut microbiota are the focus of the current research and trends for future research. Future research should focus on improving the scientific training system for athletes and quality of training and life for the general public. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Books are an important output in many fields of research. However, they pose a significant challenge for research assessment systems, partly because of the limited availability of information to support the assessment of books. To inform book assessment practices, I present a systematic examination of the ISBN Manual and the Global Register of Publishers (GRP). I evaluate the extent to which these two sources can be used to determine the genre and publisher of a book as well as the country in which a book was issued. My analysis focuses on books submitted to the research assessment systems in Lithuania and the United Kingdom from 2008 to 2020. I show how the ISBN Manual captures the complex interactions between publishers, their imprints, and other organizations active in academic publishing, revealing the pitfalls of measuring books’ quality by their publisher’s prestige. The results also indicate that the ISBN standard provides no basis for the book genres mandated by research assessment systems in some countries. Finally, I demonstrate how the ISBN Manual and metadata accumulated in the GRP are convenient tools for designers of research assessment systems and are suitable for identifying ISBN registrants and performing bibliometric analysis. © 2024 Eleonora Dagienė.

AB  - Researchers have long been interested in how governments manage their energy resources. But only in the last two decades has the idea of “energy governance” been discussed in academic literature, with scholars having focused more on it recently. The importance of energy to the growth and advancement of civilizations means that we should focus on the key “energy governance” concerns that scholars have been debating for the past 20 years. By systematically reviewing the body of research on energy governance, the goal of this study is to provide an overall impression of the intellectual atmosphere among academics in this field and to pinpoint the areas that are anticipated to garner increased attention in the future. In this paper, a comprehensive assessment of every article published on the topic of energy governance in the Scopus database was carried out using bibliometric methods and keyword convergence analysis. The information presented in this article shows how the concepts have correlated and what themes have been more significant to energy governance scholars over the years, starting in 2006 when the first article in the area was published. This article's novelty lies in its systematic analysis of the keywords used in energy governance papers and the investigation of the themes' evolutionary trends across several time periods. The results indicate that “transition to renewable energy” and “energy security” have been two of the primary concerns of energy researchers. In the past ten years, researchers have also become interested in “climate changes” and "climate governance". It is anticipated that these challenges will receive greater attention from academics in the future. Additionally, the results show that researchers have focused significantly on the “participation” of people and societies in achieving “sustainable energy” in recent years. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Background: Dengue virus (DENV) is the most widespread arbovirus. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared dengue one of the top 10 global health threats in 2019. However, it has been underrepresented in bibliometric analyses. This study employs bibliometric analysis to identify research hotspots and trends, offering a comprehensive overview of the current research dynamics in this field. Results: We present a report spanning from 1995 to 2023 that provides a unique longitudinal analysis of Dengue virus (DENV) research, revealing significant trends and shifts not extensively covered in previous literature. A total of 10,767 DENV-related documents were considered, with a notable increase in publications, peaking at 747 articles in 2021. Plos Neglected Tropical Diseases has become the leading journal in Dengue virus research, publishing 791 articles in this field—the highest number recorded. Our bibliometric analysis provides a comprehensive mapping of DENV research across multiple dimensions, including vector ecology, virology, and emerging therapies. The study delineates a complex network of immune response genes, including IFNA1, DDX58, IFNB1, STAT1, IRF3, and NFKB1, highlighting significant trends and emerging themes, particularly the impacts of climate change and new outbreaks on disease transmission. Our findings detail the progress and current status of key vaccine candidates, including the licensed Dengvaxia, newer vaccines such as Qdenga and TV003, and updated clinical trials. The study underscores significant advancements in antiviral therapies and vector control strategies for dengue, highlighting innovative drug candidates such as AT-752 and JNJ-1802, and the potential of drug repurposing with agents like Ribavirin, Remdesivir, and Lopinavir. Additionally, it discusses biological control methods, including the introduction of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and gene-editing technologies. Conclusion: This bibliometric study underscores the critical role of interdisciplinary collaboration in advancing DENV research, identifying key trends and areas needing further exploration, including host-virus dynamics, the development and application of antiviral drugs and vaccines, and the use of artificial intelligence. It advocates for strengthened partnerships across various disciplines to effectively tackle the challenges posed by DENV. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Perovskite solar cells have matched or even surpassed commercial silicone-based photovoltaics (PVs) in terms of cost effectiveness and power conversion efficiency. However, the stability is quite far behind the commercial silicone-based PV. Humidity, electrical bias, high temperature, and ultraviolet light are the determining stressors in the degradation of perovskite solar cells. This review provides the current advancement (2022 to July 31st, 2024) to the stability problem in perovskite solar cells. Equipped with bibliometric study, we deploy keyword analysis, citation analysis, and notable progress to give an overview and latest progress in perovskite solar cells stability. The importance of interface passivation is highlighted. The scalability studies of nontoxic, lead-free, stable perovskite solar cells are expected in near future. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly become important tools in Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI), potentially enabling new ways to analyze data, treat patients, and conduct research. This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of LLM applications in BHI, highlighting their transformative potential and addressing the associated ethical and practical challenges. We reviewed 1698 research articles from January 2022 to December 2023, categorizing them by research themes and diagnostic categories. Additionally, we conducted network analysis to map scholarly collaborations and research dynamics. Our findings reveal a substantial increase in the potential applications of LLMs to a variety of BHI tasks, including clinical decision support, patient interaction, and medical document analysis. Notably, LLMs are expected to be instrumental in enhancing the accuracy of diagnostic tools and patient care protocols. The network analysis highlights dense and dynamically evolving collaborations across institutions, underscoring the interdisciplinary nature of LLM research in BHI. A significant trend was the application of LLMs in managing specific disease categories, such as mental health and neurological disorders, demonstrating their potential to influence personalized medicine and public health strategies. LLMs hold promising potential to further transform biomedical research and healthcare delivery. While promising, the ethical implications and challenges of model validation call for rigorous scrutiny to optimize their benefits in clinical settings. This survey serves as a resource for stakeholders in healthcare, including researchers, clinicians, and policymakers, to understand the current state and future potential of LLMs in BHI. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Background: Cancer is a major public health challenge globally. However, little is known about the evolution patterns of cancer research communities and the influencing factors of their research capacity and impact, which is affected not only by the social networks established through research collaboration but also by the knowledge networks in which the research projects are embedded. Methods: The focus of this study was narrowed to a specific topic – 'synthetic lethality’ – in cancer research. This field has seen vibrant growth and multidisciplinary collaboration in the past decade. Multi-level collaboration and knowledge networks were established and analysed on the basis of bibliometric data from ‘synthetic lethality’-related cancer research papers. Negative binomial regression analysis was further applied to explore how node attributes within these networks, along with other potential factors, affected paper citations, which are widely accepted as proxies for assessing research capacity and impact. Results: Our study revealed that the synthetic lethality-based cancer research field is characterized by a knowledge network with high integration, alongside a collaboration network exhibiting some clustering. We found significant correlations between certain factors and citation counts. Specifically, a leading status within the nation-level international collaboration network and industry involvement were both found to be significantly related to higher citations. In the individual-level collaboration networks, lead authors’ degree centrality has an inverted U-shaped relationship with citations, while their structural holes exhibit a positive and significant effect. Within the knowledge network, however, only measures of structural holes have a positive and significant effect on the number of citations. Conclusions: To enhance cancer research capacity and impact, non-leading countries should take measures to enhance their international collaboration status. For early career researchers, increasing the number of collaborators seems to be more effective. University–industry cooperation should also be encouraged, enhancing the integration of human resources, technology, funding, research platforms and medical resources. Insights gained through this study also provide recommendations to researchers or administrators in designing future research directions from a knowledge network perspective. Focusing on unique issues especially interdisciplinary fields will improve output and influence their research work. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Purpose: The utilization of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in studying the mechanisms and treatment of chronic pain has gained significant popularity. However, there is currently a dearth of literature conducting bibliometric analysis on fMRI studies focused on chronic pain. Methods: All the literature included in this study was obtained from the Science Citation Index Expanded of Web of Science Core Collection. We used CiteSpace and VOSviewer to analyze publications, authors, countries or regions, institutions, journals, references and keywords. Additionally, we evaluated the timeline and burst analysis of keywords, as well as the timeline and burst analysis of references. The search was conducted from 2004 to 2023 and completed within a single day on October 4th, 2023. Results: A total of 1,327 articles were retrieved. The annual publication shows an overall increasing trend. The United States has the highest number of publications and the main contributing institution is Harvard University. The journal PAIN produces the most articles. In recent years, resting-state fMRI, the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, and migraines have been researched hotspots of fMRI studies on chronic pain. Conclusions: This study provides an in-depth perspective on fMRI for chronic pain research, revealing key points, research hotspots and research trends, which offers valuable ideas for future research activities. It concludes with a summary of advances in clinical practice in this area, pointing out the need for critical evaluation of these findings in the light of guidelines and expert recommendations. It is anticipated that further high-quality research outputs will be generated in the future, which will facilitate the utilization of fMRI in clinical decision-making for chronic pain. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Organisations increasingly rely on data-driven strategies, utilising analytics to achieve competitive advantages. This paper systematically investigates the integration of big data into Building Information Modeling (BIM) within the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sectors, named “big BIM data.” Employing mixed methods of systematic and bibliometric analysis, it synthesises findings from 125 records published 2013–23. While many studies are at preliminary stages with conceptual or small-scale experimental approaches, the paper categorises its results into four domains: AEC organisational infrastructure, big BIM data (IT) infrastructure, AEC organisational strategic domain, and big BIM data (IT) strategic domain, aligned with the Strategic Alignment Model (SAM), exploring organisational competencies, governance factors, and strategic frameworks. This paper introduces the AEC Organisational - Big BIM Data SAM as the research agenda to implement big BIM data utilisation across AEC industry. This framework thoroughly addresses organisational dynamics while emphasising interconnectedness among individual projects, organisational tiers, and industry-wide standards. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Over the last two decades, the phenomenon of “slum tourism” and its academic exploration have seen considerable growth. This study presents a systematic literature review of 122 peer-reviewed journal articles, employing a combined approach of bibliometric and content analysis. Our review highlights prominent authors and journals in this domain, revealing that the most cited journals usually focus on tourism studies or geography/urban studies. This reflects a confluence of travel motivations and urban complexities within slum tourism. Through keyword co-occurrence analysis, we identified three primary research areas: the touristic transformation of urban informal settlements, the depiction and valorization of urban poverty, and the socio-economic impacts of slum tourism. This study not only maps the current landscape of research in this area but also identifies existing gaps. It suggests that the economic, social, and cultural effects of slum tourism are areas that require more in-depth investigation in future research endeavors. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - To study stratification among scientists, we reconstruct the career-long trajectories of 8.2 million scientists worldwide using 12 bibliometric measures of productivity, geographical mobility, collaboration, and research impact. While most previous studies examined these variables in isolation, we study their relationships using Multiple Correspondence and Cluster Analysis. We group authors according to their bibliometric performance and academic age across six macro fields of science, and analyze co-authorship networks and detect collaboration communities of different sizes. We found a stratified structure in terms of academic age and bibliometric classes, with a small top class and large middle and bottom classes in all collaboration communities. Results are robust to community detection algorithms used and do not depend on authors’ gender. These results imply that increased productivity, impact, and collaboration are driven by a relatively small group that accounts for a large share of academic outputs, i.e., the top class. Mobility indicators are the only exception with bottom classes contributing similar or larger shares. We also show that those at the top succeed by collaborating with various authors from other classes and age groups. Nevertheless, they are benefiting disproportionately from these collaborations which may have implications for persisting stratification in academia. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Accounting education prepares future accountants for the challenges of modern business. Hence, this study has undertaken a bibliometric analysis focusing on accounting education to comprehend its research patterns, trends, source titles, authors, institutions, and research themes. The data employed in this study were collected from two databases, Scopus and Web of Science (WoS). The collected data were analyzed via ScientoPy and VOSviewer. This study revealed significant growth in accounting education research over the past three decades. With respect to the source title analysis, this study revealed that “Accounting Education” and the “Journal of Accounting Education” emerged as the most prominent in accounting education. The co-occurrence network of author keywords depicted accounting education, accounting, accounting students, and management accounting, which were frequently used by previous authors. Another intriguing finding revealed that the most cited articles cover managerial accounting, structured literature reviews, and cross-sectional analysis. The findings show that accounting education adapts to 21st-century issues and that future educators must be prepared. The study also revealed that sustainability, accounting skills, and the curriculum could be complementary research areas that benefit academics, educators, and policymakers. © 2024, Malque Publishing.

AB  - The global problem of water scarcity continues to grow because of population growth and climate change. Membrane distillation (MD) stands out as a progressing technology, demonstrating the potential for integration with operating systems powered by solar energy. Despite the increasing interest in solar-powered MD, existing literature primarily focuses on the technical aspects of the technology. There is a notable lack of comprehensive analyses that explore broader research trends, key contributors, and thematic evolution within this field. This paper addresses this gap by employing bibliometric analysis and machine learning approaches to explore trends in solar membrane desalination based on publications from 2014 to 2023. 991 publications were analyzed from various aspects, such as publications, countries, institutions, and research trends. Hot keywords include “membrane distillation”, “reverse osmosis”, “energy efficiency”, and “evaporation”. China had the highest number of publications and h-index, followed by the United States, and Saudi Arabia. The study clustered the keywords into three themes: membrane distillation, membrane materials, and reverse osmosis. Analysis of the thematic map reveals seven main research topics in solar-powered membrane desalination, classified according to their degree of relevance. Finally, future directions of membrane desalination are highlighted, including exploring economic and environmental aspects. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to conduct a bibliometric analysis of research articles on the relationship between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) using CiteSpace to summarize the current research status, hotspots, and trends in this field and present the results visually. Method: Research articles on the relationship between IBD and CRC published from 2000 to 2023 and in English were selected from the Web of Science Core Collection (Woscc) database. The articles were downloaded as “full record and references”. CiteSpace was used to conduct cooperative, cluster, co-citation, and burst analyses. Results: The literature search revealed 4244 articles; of which, 5 duplicates were removed, resulting in the inclusion of 4239 articles in this study. The United States of America had the highest number of publications, with Mayo Clinic and Harvard University being the most active institutions, and Bas Oldenburg being the most active author. Collaboration among core authors was inadequate. JA Eaden was the most cited author, and CRC was the most common keyword. Burst analysis indicated that Sun Yat-sen University might be one of the institutions with a large contribution to this research field in the future. Cluster analysis showed that earlier research focused more on microsatellite instability, whereas “gut microbiota” and “oxidative stress” are considered current research hotspots and trends. Conclusion: At present, the primary focus areas of research are “gut microbiota” and “oxidative stress”. With the improvement of healthcare policies and standards, regular endoscopic monitoring of patients with IBD has become an indispensable diagnostic and therapeutic practice. More drugs will be developed to reduce the risk of progression from IBD to CRC. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the relationship between IBD and CRC for researchers in the same field. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Ferroptosis is a novel form of lipid peroxidation-driven, iron-dependent programmed cell death. Various metabolic pathways, including those involved in lipid and iron metabolism, contribute to ferroptosis regulation. The gut microbiota not only supplies nutrients and energy to the host, but also plays a crucial role in immune modulation and metabolic balance. In this review, we explore the metabolic pathways associated with ferroptosis and the impact of the gut microbiota on host metabolism. We subsequently summarize recent studies on the influence and regulation of ferroptosis by the gut microbiota and discuss potential mechanisms through which the gut microbiota affects ferroptosis. Additionally, we conduct a bibliometric analysis of the relationship between the gut microbiota and ferroptosis in the context of chronic kidney disease. This analysis can provide new insights into the current research status and future of ferroptosis and the gut microbiota. (Figure presented.) © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are vascular malformations of the central nervous system (CNS) with potential for significant consequences. The exact pathophysiologic mechanism of AVM formation is not fully understood. This study aims to evaluate bibliometric parameters and citations of the literature of AVMs to provide an overview of how the field has evolved. We performed an electronic search on Web of Science to identify the top 100 published and indexed articles with the highest number of citations discussing the pathogenesis of AVMs. This study yielded 1863 articles, of which the top 100 were selected based on the highest total citation count. These articles included 24% basic science, 46% clinical, and 30% review articles. The most-cited article was a clinical article from 2003, and the most recent was published in 2022. The median number of authors was 6, with the highest being 46 for a clinical article. The top 5 journals were identified, with the highest impact factor being 20.1. 13 countries were identified, with the US contributing the most articles (approximately 70%). Regarding genes of investigation, VEGF was one of the early genes investigated, while more interested in RAS/MAPK has been garnered since 2015. There is a growing interest in AVM genomics and pathogenesis research. While progress has been made in understanding clinical aspects and risk factors, the exact pathophysiological mechanisms and genetic basis of AVM formation remain incompletely understood. Further investigation of key genes in AVM pathogenesis can allow identification of potential therapeutic targets. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Background: Recently, the application of deep learning (DL) has made great progress in various fields, especially in cancer research. However, to date, the bibliometric analysis of the application of DL in cancer is scarce. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the research status and hotspots of the application of DL in cancer. Methods: We retrieved all articles on the application of DL in cancer from the Web of Science database Core Collection database. Biblioshiny, VOSviewer and CiteSpace were used to perform the bibliometric analysis through analyzing the numbers, citations, countries, institutions, authors, journals, references, and keywords. Results: We found 6,016 original articles on the application of DL in cancer. The number of annual publications and total citations were uptrend in general. China published the greatest number of articles, USA had the highest total citations, and Saudi Arabia had the highest centrality. Chinese Academy of Sciences was the most productive institution. Tian, Jie published the greatest number of articles, while He Kaiming was the most co-cited author. IEEE Access was the most popular journal. The analysis of references and keywords showed that DL was mainly used for the prediction, detection, classification and diagnosis of breast cancer, lung cancer, and skin cancer. Conclusions: Overall, the number of articles on the application of DL in cancer is gradually increasing. In the future, further expanding and improving the application scope and accuracy of DL applications, and integrating DL with protein prediction, genomics and cancer research may be the research trends. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The rise of robotic surgery throughout the world, particularly in Latin America, justifies an objective evaluation of research in this field. This study aimed to use bibliometric techniques to identify the research trends and patterns of robotic surgery in Latin America. The research strategy used the terms “Robotic,” “Surgery,” and the name of all the Latin American countries, in all fields and collections of Web of Science database. Only original articles published between 2009 and 2022 were included. The software Rayyan, Bibliometric in the R Studio, and VOSViewer were used to develop the analyses. After screening, 96 articles were included from 60 different journals. There was a 22.51% annual increase in the scientific production of robotic surgery in the period studied. The more frequent topics by specialty were: Urology (35.4%), General Surgery (34.4%), and Obstetrics and Gynecology (12%). International cooperation was observed in 65.62% of the studies. The Latin American institution with the highest production of manuscripts was the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. Mexico, Chile, and Brazil were, in descending order, the nations with the highest number of corresponding authors and total citations. When considering the total number of articles, Brazil ranked ahead of Chile. Scientific production regarding robotic surgery in Latin America has experienced accelerated growth since its beginning, supported by the high degree of collaboration with leading countries in the field. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The low FODMAP diet is the most recommended dietary intervention for the clinical management of IBS symptoms. Bibliometrics analysis provides a comprehensive perspective and direction on global research trend and hotspot in the low FODMAP diet research. The restriction stage of the low FODMAP diet is superior to other dietary therapies for IBS in terms of symptom response, but it has a negative impact on the abundance of gut Bifidobacteria and diet quality. Identification of biomarkers to predict response to the low FODMAP diet has become the current research hotspot. Large, well-designed clinical research studies are needed in the future to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of the low FODMAP diet, including FODMAP reintroduction and personalization stages. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) is a rare congenital heart disease characterized by the inability of all pulmonary veins to connect to the left atrium. Our previous bibliometric article summarized the characteristics of only the 100 most cited papers in TAPVC research. The purpose of this study was to use comprehensive bibliometric analysis to examine the development history, current status, and future trends in the field of TAPVC. Methods: All publications on TAPVC published between 2000 and 2023 were collected from the Web of Science Core Collection. The publication and citation data were quantitatively analyzed by publication year, country, institution, author, and journal. Co-authorship and co-occurrence analyses were performed using VOSviewer, and keyword and reference bursts were identified using CiteSpace. Pearson’s test was used to examine the correlations between two continuous variables. Results: As of July 20, 2023, we identified 368 publications with 3320 citations. These publications were published in 132 journals and authored by 1835 researchers from 457 institutions in 47 countries. For the number of publications, the top country, top institution, top author, and top journals were the United States (n = 82), Shanghai Jiao Tong University (n = 13), Huiwen Chen (n = 9), and Annals of Thoracic Surgery and Pediatric Cardiology (n = 29 each), respectively. For the number of citations, the top country, top affiliation, top author, and top journal were the United States (n = 1348), University of Toronto (n = 250), Christopher A. Caldarone (n = 315), and Annals of Thoracic Surgery (n = 746), respectively. The number of national publications significantly correlated with GDP (R = 0.887, P < 0.001), research & development (R&D) expenditure (R = 0.375, P = 0.013), population (R = 0.694, P < 0.001), and journals (R = 0.751, P < 0.001). The number of national citations significantly correlated with GDP (R = 0.881, P < 0.001), R&D expenditure (R = 0.446, P = 0.003), population (R = 0.305, P = 0.037), and journals (R = 0.917, P < 0.001). International collaboration in the field of TAPVC was not well developed. The most commonly cited publication discussed era changes in mortality and reoperation rate in TAPVC patients. The most common keywords were “total anomalous pulmonary venous connection” and “congenital heart disease”. The keyword “case report” appeared most recently, with an average occurrence year of 2021.8. The co-occurrence analysis grouped 26 keywords into six themes: surgical repair of TAPVC, postoperative pulmonary vein stenosis, surgical repair of TAPVC patients with heterotaxy, application of echocardiography in diagnosing TAPVC, application of echocardiography in the prenatal diagnosis of TAPVC, and application of the sutureless technique in the surgical repair of TAPVC patients with right atrial isomerism or a single ventricle. Citation burst detection identified 32 references with citation bursts, seven of which had ongoing citation bursts until 2023. Conclusions: This study conducted a bibliometric analysis to provide a comprehensive overview of TAPVC research. We hope to offer new ideas for promoting development in the field of TAPVC. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This paper examines the literature on the Sustainability in the Arctic region, using a bibliometric analysis of 213 English-language articles published between 1980 and 2022 exploiting Bibliometrix, an R package. To find relevant literature using the Web of Science (WOS) database, we searched for documents using mesh terms based on the query of two terms, “Arctic & Sustainability”. We used the Boolean operator “AND” to combine the two terms and the Boolean operator “OR” to include synonyms of the terms. The articles retrieved were authored by 724 researchers, published in 98 journals, representing 132 countries, and growing at 5.08% annually. The findings reveal that a substantial portion of the Arctic sustainability literature placed significant emphasis on the examination of climate change, adaptation, and vulnerabilities affecting local communities. Furthermore, the more recent publications in this field concentrate predominantly on exploring perceptions and governance. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Introduction: The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) chat programs has opened two distinct paths, one enhancing interaction and another potentially replacing personal understanding. Ethical and legal concerns arise due to the rapid development of these programs. This paper investigates academic discussions on AI in medicine, analyzing the context, frequency, and reasons behind these conversations. Methods: The study collected data from the Web of Science database on articles containing the keyword “ChatGPT” published from January to September 2023, resulting in 786 medically related journal articles. The inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed articles in English related to medicine. Results: The United States led in publications (38.1%), followed by India (15.5%) and China (7.0%). Keywords such as “patient” (16.7%), “research” (12%), and “performance” (10.6%) were prevalent. The Cureus Journal of Medical Science (11.8%) had the most publications, followed by the Annals of Biomedical Engineering (8.3%). August 2023 had the highest number of publications (29.3%), with significant growth between February to March and April to May. Medical General Internal (21.0%) was the most common category, followed by Surgery (15.4%) and Radiology (7.9%). Discussion: The prominence of India in ChatGPT research, despite lower research funding, indicates the platform’s popularity and highlights the importance of monitoring its use for potential medical misinformation. China’s interest in ChatGPT research suggests a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) AI applications, despite public bans on the platform. Cureus’ success in publishing ChatGPT articles can be attributed to its open-access, rapid publication model. The study identifies research trends in plastic surgery, radiology, and obstetric gynecology, emphasizing the need for ethical considerations and reliability assessments in the application of ChatGPT in medical practice. Conclusion: ChatGPT’s presence in medical literature is growing rapidly across various specialties, but concerns related to safety, privacy, and accuracy persist. More research is needed to assess its suitability for patient care and implications for non-medical use. Skepticism and thorough review of research are essential, as current studies may face retraction as more information emerges. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: This bibliometric study aims to examine the associations of journals in the field of human reproduction with their access types and article processing charges to evaluate the evolving landscape of publishing in human reproduction. Methods: The primary databases, including Clarivate Analytics Master Journal List, Scopus®, PubMed, and Directory of Open Access Journals, were scrutinized to identify pertinent journals within the realm of human reproduction, utilizing keywords such as reproductive, reproduction, fertility, and infertility. Journals were excluded if they were not actively publishing in English or primarily focused on reproductive health, men’s health, sexual medicine, embryogenesis, developmental biology, or veterinary medicine concerning animal reproduction. A thorough characterization of the journals was conducted, followed by a comparative analysis of citation metrics and article processing charges across various access models. Results: Forty-one journals were included into the study. A significant increase in the proportion of gold and diamond open-access journals was observed, rising from 42% (13 out of 31) to 53.6% (22 out of 41) by 2023. Hybrid journals demonstrated superior citation metrics compared to diamond open-access journals. For hybrid journals, a statistically significant, moderately positive correlation was found between article processing charges and CiteScore (rs (27) = 0.515, p <.024). Conversely, no correlation was observed between article processing charges and CiteScore for gold open-access journals (rs (27) = 0.445, p = 0.147). The mean article processing charges for all hybrid and gold open-access journals were calculated as US $3032.88 ± 1108.514 (312 to 4430). Specifically, the mean article processing charges for hybrid journals (US $3617.4 ± 610.19) were significantly higher than those for gold open-access journals (US $1916.82 ± 988.32), with a difference of 1700.658 (95% CI: 1124.861–2276.455), t (30) = 6.032, and p <.0005. Conclusion: Hybrid journals in the field of human reproduction carry fees nearly twice as high as those of gold open-access journals. The charging policies of gold open-access journals, which are not contigent upon citation metrics, emphasize the importance of caution for both authors and funders. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the current landscape of ChatGPT application in the medical field, assessing the current collaboration patterns and research topic hotspots to understand the impact and trends. By conducting a search in the Web of Science, we collected literature related to the applications of ChatGPT in medicine, covering the period from January 1, 2000 up to January 16, 2024. Bibliometric analyses were performed using CiteSpace (V6.2., Drexel University, PA, USA) and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp.,WA, USA) to map the collaboration among countries/regions, the distribution of institutions and authors, and clustering of keywords. A total of 574 eligible articles were included, with 97.74% published in 2023. These articles span various disciplines, particularly in Health Care Sciences Services, with extensive international collaboration involving 73 countries. In terms of countries/regions studied, USA, India, and China led in the number of publications. USA ot only published nearly half of the total number of papers but also exhibits a highest collaborative capability. Regarding the co-occurrence of institutions and scholars, the National University of Singapore and Harvard University held significant influence in the cooperation network, with the top three authors in terms of publications being Wiwanitkit V (10 articles), Seth I (9 articles), Klang E (7 articles), and Kleebayoon A (7 articles).

AB  - Emerging technology presents itself as a futuristic solution since its early development stage in the industry. Concurrently, the industry has proposed framework implementations as well as efforts to integrate emerging technologies in the supply chain, particularly in logistics. This study aimed to unveil the applicability of either supply chain or logistic functions in the present industry. This study used Publish and Perish to mine academic document data based on the keyword ‘Logistic’ and ‘Emerging technology’ in the past five years. Furthermore, the retrieved data were compiled and processed as a bibliographical map to visualize relevant clusters as the bottom-line discussion for this study. Five clusters had different items/keywords associated with them, excluding clusters three and four which were discussed in tandem. Cluster one revealed that AI and blockchain could support manufacturers for a circular economy business model through reverse logistics operations in the pandemic. Cluster two was a bigger picture discussing enhancement efficiency and risk reduction in the supply chain using AI, blockchain, and IoT. Clusters three and four had overlapping keywords specifying the discussion of blockchain implementation for the Agri-industry in China. Finally, cluster five reaffirmed the conceptualism of emerging technology integration for transportation from other clusters. Despite a unanimous agreement on the potential use of emerging technologies, challenges were also found, such as complex implementation, uncertain investment, and technology immaturity accompany. Thus, as the implication of this research, it reveals the capabilities and issues of the implementation of emerging technologies within multiple aspects of logistics and supply chain. © 2024, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to examine the global research trend and frontiers in the field of root caries. Methods: Two independent investigators searched the Web of Science Core Collection to include journal articles published on root caries from 1994 to 2023. They examined citation trends of the selected publications and performed bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer. Cooccurrence and cocitation analysis were used to calculate the burst strength of the most cited keywords and the most cited publications. Results: This study included 1144 publications (1004 scientific research articles and 140 review articles) for bibliometric analysis. The number of publications from 2018 to 2023 was 404, accounting for 35% (404/1144) over the last 30 years. The annual citation count showed a gradual upward trend with a surge from 2018. The cooccurrence analysis classified the publications into four clusters which were in vitro studies, prevention, microbiology, and epidemiology. Cocitation analysis revealed silver diamine fluoride, systematic review, and randomized clinical trial were the three main keywords; and their citation burst strength (period) were 17.2 (2017-2023), 9.4 (2015-2023), and 6.9 (2018-2023), respectively. Noninvasive treatment of root caries (narrative review), aetiology of root caries (narrative review), and use of silver diamine fluoride in arresting root caries (clinical trial) were the topics (publication type) of the three most cited publications; and their burst strength (period) were 8.9 (2017-2020), 5.9 (2017-2021), and 4.7 (2015-2018), respectively. Conclusion: This study highlights the recent growing research interest in root caries, particularly on its microbiology, prevention, and the use of silver diamine fluoride. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Background: Oral cancer (OC) is a multifactorial disease that affects the oral cavity. The mortality rate is approximately 50 % and a high percentage of patients are diagnosed in advanced stages. Early diagnosis has been well demonstrated to improve overall survival, mainly when detected at a localized stage. Non-invasive techniques can help identify malignant features in real time, thus improving the path to diagnosis. This study aimed to perform a bibliometric analysis of the top 100 articles cited on diagnostic aids for oral cancer. Methods: Articles from 2000 to 2023 in Scopus were scanned using five OC topic titles crossed with 27 diagnostic aid keywords. Duplicate manuscripts were eliminated using Microsoft Excel software and publications were ranked according to their citation count. This study selected and analyzed the top 100 most cited English-language papers. Results: 86,676 citations were accumulated by the top 100 articles most cited. 2011 was the year with the highest number of publications with OC papers. The article with the most citations obtained a total of 30,832. The United States was the country with the most publications, with a total of 45, and UCLA was the institution with the most publications (7) among the top 100 most cited papers. Conclusions: This study identified the top 100 most cited articles on diagnostic aids for oral cancer. These results can help dentists, specialists, healthcare providers, and researchers become familiar with the most influential publications in this field. © 2024

AB  - The provision of sustainable housing should factor energy efficiency, the use of sustainable building methods and materials and address the current associated barriers. This consideration triggered an ongoing study in UK which has so far conducted a bibliometric analysis of 275 papers using the VOSviewer software. More papers have been published in the last 5 years compared to the previous 15, and the UK is less engaged in successful collaborations in comparison to other economically developed nations. The lesser use of innovation in the UK has been identified. Also, the uses of sustainable methods and materials in residential housing are not fully exploited for achieving energy efficiency. A future research direction emerging is the potential to study the combined impact of using innovative materials and methods to achieve greater energy efficiency in UK housing provision. Through technological innovations and the need to move from fossil fuels (for example, through the use of heat pumps) a new approach can move the UK closer to achieving net-zero in housing provision and operations. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: This study aims to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the current literature related to facial feminization surgery (FFS) and facial masculinization surgery (FMS) to understand the patterns, trends, and evolution of research topics. In addition, it aims to objectively identify the important articles that constitute the primary backbone of the FFS/FMS literature and provide a resource for education and new studies in this emerging field. Results: Using the principles of the Leiden Manifesto, 384 publications from the Web of Science from 1987 to 2023 were analyzed. The analysis included cross-country collaboration, keyword trends, affiliations, co-citation networks, and clustering. The results showed an increasing trend in FFS/FMS publications, with the USA leading in both publications (n = 238) and citations (n = 2420). The most cited journal was the Journal of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery. The results indicate a high growth rate, with an H-index of 34 and an average citation of 11.41 per article. Co-occurrence analysis revealed evolving keywords such as “forehead” (n = 52) and “quality of life” (n = 44). The timeline view illustrated the terms reflecting current areas of interest such as #patient satisfaction and #gender-affirming care. Conclusion: The study reveals the influence of countries, institutions, authors, and emerging trends, supporting the anticipation that FFS/FMS will be a critical field of study in the future. The findings contribute to understanding the global landscape of FFS/FMS research, facilitating informed decision-making for researchers, and clinicians in the field of maxillofacial surgery. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This paper evaluates how the contribution of scientific publications on climate change from the University of São Paulo (USP) evolved between 1989 and 2022. The study conducted a bibliometric analysis of 2874 research articles collected from the Web of Science and Scopus databases to explore main trend topics and reveal influential journals and collaboration networks using the Bibliometrix software. The study shows an increasing and more significant temporal publication distribution from 2010 onwards. Based on the author’s affiliations, results indicate that the most important partnerships are national (67%), while the international co-authorships are predominantly with research collaborators of the Global North (North America and Europe). Several papers published in the period are in high-impact factor journals, evidence on climate change from USP. Environmental services, Atlantic Forest, Tropical Forest, Amazon, biodiversity, and Land use are the hotspot research topics to which USP researchers contribute. The evolution of three thematic groups was identified: (i) physical science, (ii) causes and effects, and (iii) strategies, discussed in themes such as organic matter, deforestation, and mitigation, respectively. This research is helpful to get insights into the current research development trends, to show the broadness of the scientific production, and the importance of the USP role in the climate change theme. Ultimately, it provides valuable information for further studies and suggests the possibility of advancing the research agenda on climate change with the Global South.

AB  - Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a nematode and model organism whose entire genome has been mapped, which allows for easy observation of the organism’s development due to its transparent structure, and which is appealing due to its ease of crossover, ease of culture, and low cost. Despite being separated by nearly a billion years of evolution, C. elegans homologs have been identified for the vast majority of human genes and are associated with C. elegans for many biological processes such as apoptosis, cell signaling, cell cycle, cell polarity, metabolism, and aging. A detailed bibliometric study is performed here to examine publication trends in this field. Data were taken from the Web of Science database and analyzed using the bibliometric application Biblioshiny (RStudio). In terms of publication, the results indicated a gradual increase each year between 1980 and 2023. A total of 20,322 records were issued in 96 countries, the majority of which were in the USA, China, and Japan. The most prolific writers, the journals most engaged in the area, the nations, institutions, and keywords used by authors were all determined using the Web of Science database and bibliometric rules. The number of papers in the C. elegans research field is increasing exponentially, and Genetics is the journal with the highest number of articles. This study presents how research patterns have evolved throughout time. As a result, worldwide cooperation and a potential field can be developed. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - To carry out an in-depth analysis of the scientific research on autoimmunity, we performed the first bibliometric analysis focusing on publications in journals dedicated to autoimmunity (JDTA) indexed by science citation index during the period 2004–2023. Using bibliometric analysis, we quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed the country, institution, author, reference and keywords information of publications in JDTA, so as to understand the quantity, publication pattern and publication characteristics of these publications. The co-occurrence networks, clustering map and timeline map were created by CiteSpace and VOSviewer software to visualize the results. The CiteSpace was also used to analyze the strongest citation burst of keywords, which could describe the frequency, intensity and time period of high-frequency keywords, and indicate the research hotspots in the field. A total of 5 710 publications were analyzed, and their annual distribution number was basically stable from 2004 to 2023, fluctuating around 300. The United States and Italy led the way in terms of the number of publications, followed by France and China. For international cooperation, the developed countries represented by the United States cooperate more closely, but the cooperation was localized, reflecting that there was no unified model of autoimmunity among countries. UDICE-French Research Universities had the greatest number of publications. Subsequently, the number of publications decreased slowly with the ranking, and the gradient was not large. Eric Gershwin and Yehuda Shoenfeld stood out among the authors. They had an excellent academic reputation and great influence in the field of autoimmunity. The results of keyword analysis showed that JDTA publications mainly studied a variety of autoimmune diseases, especially SLE and RA. At the same time, JDTA publications also paid special attention to the research of cell function, autoantibody expression, animal experiments, disease activity, pathogenesis and treatment. This study is the first to analyze the publications in JDTA from multiple indicators by bibliometrics, thus providing new insights into the research hotspots and development trends in the field of autoimmunity. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Introduction: The present investigation examined the trend of publications and ranking in Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine of European countries during the years 1996 to 2022 and compared these with all the regions globally. Methods: In September 2023, the SCOPUS data of publications in Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine from the SCImago Journal & Country Rank website were retrieved. All the data from Western and Eastern Europe were extracted from the overall data of the global countries and merged into Excel files, for each of the years 1996–2022 and 2022. Results: Western European countries contributed significantly to the global share of publications in Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine with nearly 1/3rd of the total publications. Eastern European countries’ contribution was minimal to the global publications and was almost 10 times less than the Western European countries. The total number of publications in the area of Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine from 1996 to 2022 at the European scale was led by the United Kingdom (N = 51510) and has maintained its supremacy until recently, in 2022. Amongst Western European countries, during the cumulative period of 1996–2022, the maximum contributions were made by the United Kingdom (N = 51510), and also in 2022, the United Kingdom contributed maximally (N = 3339). In the cumulative period of 1996–2022, Poland contributed maximally (N = 4049) among the Eastern European countries. In 2022, the maximum contribution from the Eastern European countries came from the Russian Federation (N = 462). Conclusion: The European continent is the major contributor to Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine research and publications, with almost 1/3rd of the global share of publications. Western European countries are far ahead in their contributions than Eastern European countries. © 2024

AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder, but its diagnosis and treatment remain obscure. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), as potential biomarkers, have attracted increasing attention in digestive diseases. Here, we present a comprehensive research status, development trends, and valuable insights in this subject area. The literature search was performed using Web of Science Core Collection. VOSviewer 1.6.20, Citespace 6.2.R4, and Microsoft Excel 2021 were used for bibliometric analysis. A total of 124 articles were included in the analysis. Overall, publication patterns fluctuated. Globally, People’s Republic of China, the USA, and Germany were the top three contributors of publications. Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, University of California, Mayo Clinic, and University of California, Los Angeles contributed the highest number of publications. The pathways and specific mechanisms by which ncRNAs regulate transcription and translation and thus regulate the pathophysiological processes of IBS are the main research hotspots in this field. We found that microRNA (miRNAs) are intricately involved in the regulation of key pathologies such as viscera sensitivity, intestinal permeability, intestinal mucosal barrier, immunoinflammatory response, and brain-gut axis in the IBS, and these topics have garnered significant attention in research community. Notably, microecological disorders are also associated with IBS pathogenesis, and ncRNA may play an important role in the interactions between host and intestinal flora. This is the first bibliometric study to comprehensively summarize the research hotspots and trends related to IBS and ncRNAs (especially miRNAs). Our findings will help understand the role of ncRNAs in IBS and provide guidance to future studies. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: Thyroid cancer is a leading endocrine malignancy, with anaplastic and medullary subtypes posing treatment challenges. Existing therapies have limited efficacy, highlighting a need for innovative approaches. Methods: We analyzed 658 articles and 87 eligible clinical trials using bibliometric tools and database searches, including annual publication and citation trends, were executed using Web of Science, CiteSpace, and VOS Viewer. Results: Post-2018, there is a surge in thyroid cancer immunotherapy research, primarily from China and the University of Pisa. Of the 87 trials, 32 were Phase I and 55 were Phase II, mostly exploring combination therapies involving immune checkpoint inhibitors. Conclusion: The study's dual approach verifies the swift advancement of thyroid cancer immunotherapy from diverse perspectives. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have become the preferred regimen for advanced MTC and ATC in late therapeutic lines. However, since ICB plays a pivotal role in ATC, current clinical trial data show that ATC patients account for more and the curative effect is more accurate. Anticipated future developments are inclined toward combination regimens integrating immunotherapy with chemotherapy or targeted therapies. Emerging approaches, such as bispecific antibodies, cytokine-based therapies, and adoptive cell therapies like CAR-T and TCR-T, are exhibiting considerable potential. Upcoming research is expected to concentrate on refining the tumor immune milieu and discovering novel biomarkers germane to immunotherapeutic interventions. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - As the crypto-asset ecosystem matures, the use of high-frequency data has become increasingly common in decentralized finance literature. Using bibliometric analysis, we characterize the existing cryptocurrency literature that employs high-frequency data. We highlighted the most influential authors, articles, and journals based on 189 articles from the Scopus database from 2015 to 2022. This approach enables us to identify emerging trends and research hotspots with the aid of co-citation and cartographic analyses. It shows knowledge expansion through authors’ collaboration in cryptocurrency research with co-authorship analysis. We identify four major streams of research: (i) return prediction and measurement of cryptocurrency volatility, (ii) (in)efficiency of cryptocurrencies, (iii) price dynamics and bubbles in cryptocurrencies, and (iv) the diversification, safe haven, and hedging properties of Bitcoin. We conclude that highly traded cryptocurrencies’ investment features and economic outcomes are analyzed predominantly on a tick-by-tick basis. This study also provides recommendations for future studies. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Conducting clinical trials can evaluate the effectiveness and safety of surgical robots. To promote the advancement of academic robotic programs in surgery, this study captures the development trend and research hotspots of clinical trials related to surgical robots by bibliometric analysis. Bibliometrix package in R software was used to analyze the publication year, authors, countries, institutes, and journals. The visualization maps of keywords were formed using VOSviewer. The keywords with the strongest citation bursts and the institutional collaboration map were created by CiteSpace. Urology dominates with 31.3% of publications and the controlled clinical trials in urology and orthopedic accounted for the highest proportion, reaching 73%. North America, the USA, and Seoul National University lead in productivity. The most productive country, region and institution are North America, USA and Seoul National University, respectively. The trend of collaboration is regional instead of international. Keyword and burst keyword analysis revealed a primary focus in clinical research on robotic surgery: evaluating process improvements, comparing robotic and traditional surgery, and assessing feasibility. Long-term clinical trials assess surgical robots not only intraoperative performance but also postoperative complications and overall surgical outcomes. The development in the field is unbalanced between regions and countries. To promote multi-center clinical trials, governments can streamline review procedures and establish international consensus review standards, while academic institutions can form academic alliances. Also, the study offers recommendations for the development of academic robotic programs and regional collaboration units in robotic surgery, which may provide researchers with a strong reference for future research. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - This study conducted bibliometric and systematic analyses of the literature to map the application of life cycle assessment studies on photovoltaic panels, focusing on end-of-life alternatives. Seventy-six articles addressing management strategies, treatment, recycling, and utilization of the panels were examined. The results revealed a significant increase in the number of publications over time, particularly in high-impact journals. Sixteen end-of-life alternatives for the panels were identified, including recycling practices, material recovery, and landfills. All alternatives were analyzed regarding environmental, social, and economic impacts. Understanding the impacts of different end-of-life methods for solar panels is key in supporting government management and the implementation of effective policies and regulations. Additionally, it is necessary to consider the environmental and social effects, as well as ensure the protection of workers involved in related activities and prevent soil, water, and air contamination caused by different types of alternatives, such as dissolution and incineration. To enhance the recycling and recovery of elements from solar panels, scientific advancements and improvements in industrial infrastructure are necessary along with the implementation of a regional logistics approach that minimizes emissions resulting from transportation. The bibliometric analysis indicates that 65% of the studies were published within the last 3 years, and one quarter of the trending keywords of this period is “recycling”. This is particularly relevant to show a major area for research in the solar industry. By means of the systematic analysis, this study compiles and synthetizes the most recent and relevant alternatives for managing end-of-life photovoltaic panels. The comprehensive overview of the impacts associated with these alternatives contributes to the literature and practice of sustainability in the energy sector, providing support for informed decisions directed towards implementation. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - New advancements in virtual reality-related technologies have led to an increased interest of scholars from elementary school to higher education in its use in education. Yet, the use of virtual reality in educational environments is still in its early stages of adoption. This study aims to analyze the global landscape of virtual reality-related technologies for educational purposes. We combined bibliometrics and network analysis to analyze 1242 patent records comprising these technologies, collected in the Derwent Innovations Index. We found a significant increase in annual patenting from 2016 onward, most carried out by Chinese corporate and academic organizations. The most frequent technologies comprise teaching/training simulators, specific business systems/methods, and user–computer interaction. In the network of international patent classification codes, the overall most central node refers to technologies for manipulating three-dimensional models or images for computer graphics. Our study provides insights into the global patent landscape related to virtual reality and education, and we hope it can be of interest to potential users in academic settings, as well as developers of related technologies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Residual concentrations of some trace elements and lightweight metals, including cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, silver, zinc, nickel, chromium, arsenic, gallium, indium, gold, cobalt, polonium, and thallium, are widely detected in aquatic ecosystems globally. Although their origin may be natural, human activities significantly elevate their environmental concentrations. Metals, renowned pollutants, threaten various organisms, particularly crustaceans. Due to their feeding habits and habitat, crustaceans are highly exposed to contaminants and are considered a crucial link in xenobiotic transfer through the food chain. Moreover, crustaceans absorb metals via their gills, crucial pathways for metal uptake in water. This review summarises the adverse effects of well-studied metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Hg, Zn, Ni, Cr, As, Co) and synthesizes knowledge on the toxicity of less-studied metals (Ag, Ga, In, Au, Pl, Tl), their presence in waters, and impact on crustaceans. Bibliometric analysis underscores the significance of this topic. In general, the toxic effects of the examined metals can decrease survival rates by inducing oxidative stress, disrupting biochemical balance, causing histological damage, interfering with endocrine gland function, and inducing cytotoxicity. Metal exposure can also result in genotoxicity, reduced reproduction, and mortality. Despite current toxicity knowledge, there remains a research gap in this field, particularly concerning the toxicity of rare earth metals, presenting a potential future challenge. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Nowadays, despite centuries of striving for equality, women still face higher levels of discrimination compared to men in nearly every aspect of life. Recently, this systemic inequality has manifested in cyberspace through the proliferation of abusive content that is even more aggressive than what one would expect in the 21st century. Various research disciplines are now attempting to characterise this new manifestation of misogyny. The endeavour to comprehend this phenomenon has resulted in a significant increase in publications from several fields, including Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities, Psychology, and Computer Science. This paper presents a systematic review of multidisciplinary research on misogyny from the years 1990 to 2022, encompassing a total of 2830 articles retrieved from the Scopus database as of December 31, 2022. The literature is thoroughly analysed using three approaches: bibliometric analysis, topic detection, and qualitative analysis of the documents. The findings suggest that the analysis of online misogyny has been the primary driver behind the exponential growth in publications in this field. Additionally, the results of the topic analysis and topic interaction reveal a limited connection between the areas of knowledge that are necessary to fully grasp this complex phenomenon. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - It is well understood that many of civil projects require large sums of money annually to preserve their assets during the operation phase. Operation and maintenance costs typically account for over 80% of life cycle costs (LCC). Thus, decision-making based solely on ownership costs cannot be optimal in the long run. To address this concern, the use of LCC is suggested for assessing project cost performance. The diversity of civil projects and the importance of decision-making in such projects have led to the development of numerous studies in this field. Given the diversity of LCC-related problems and its special place in the scientific community, various studies have been conducted. Yet, the substantial number of studies poses a challenge in identifying research procedures and emerging areas. Therefore, scientometric techniques were used to analyze 2804 papers published (to date) by researchers in this field. The co-occurrence network of keywords, co-authorship of authors, and journal citations were examined, and renowned authors and research fields were identified. The results indicated that 57% of studies related to infrastructure and 43% buildings. Also, the literature on LCC-based structural design, one of the newest and perhaps most neglected branches was analyzed. One of the gaps in this field is overlooking the analysis of LCC adoption in the seismic design optimization of high-rise and irregular structures, which needs much more attention to be paid in future studies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the Iran University of Science and Technology 2024.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to analyze and map scientific literature on Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) and Serotonin Syndrome (SS) from prestigious, internationally indexed journals. The objective was to identify key topics, impactful articles, prominent journals, research output, growth patterns, hotspots, and leading countries in the field, providing valuable insights for scholars, medical students, and international funding agencies. Methods: A systematic search strategy was implemented in the PubMed MeSH database using specific keywords for NMS and SS. The search was conducted in the Scopus database, renowned for its extensive coverage of scholarly publications. Inclusion criteria comprised articles published from 1950 to December 31st, 2022, restricted to journal research and review articles written in English. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel for descriptive analysis, and VOSviewer was employed for bibliometric mapping. Results: The search yielded 1150 articles on NMS and 587 on SS, with the majority being case reports. Growth patterns revealed a surge in NMS research between 1981 and 1991, while SS research increased notably between 1993 and 1997. Active countries and journals differed between NMS and SS, with psychiatry journals predominating for NMS and pharmacology/toxicology journals for SS. Authorship analysis indicated higher multi-authored articles for NMS. Top impactful articles focused on review articles and pathogenic mechanisms. Research hotspots included antipsychotics and catatonia for NMS, while SS highlighted drug interactions and specific medications like linezolid and tramadol. Conclusions: NMS and SS represent rare but life-threatening conditions, requiring detailed clinical and scientific understanding. Differential diagnosis and management necessitate caution in prescribing medications affecting central serotonin or dopamine systems, with awareness of potential drug interactions. International diagnostic tools and genetic screening tests may aid in safe diagnosis and prevention. Reporting rare cases and utilizing bibliometric analysis enhance knowledge dissemination and research exploration in the field of rare drug-induced medical conditions. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: In the Netherlands, university medical centres (UMCs) bear primary responsibility for conducting medical research and delivering highly specialized care. The TopCare program was a policy experiment lasting 4 years in which three non-academic hospitals received funding from the Dutch Ministry of Health to also conduct medical research and deliver highly specialized care in specific domains. This study investigates research collaboration outcomes for all Dutch UMCs and non-academic hospitals in general and, more specifically, for the domains in the non-academic hospitals participating in the TopCare program. Additionally, it explores the organizational boundary work employed by these hospitals to foster productive research collaborations. Methods: A mixed method research design was employed combining quantitative bibliometric analysis of publications and citations across all Dutch UMCs and non-academic hospitals and the TopCare domains with geographical distances, document analysis and ethnographic interviews with actors in the TopCare program. Results: Quantitative analysis shows that, over the period of study, international collaboration increased among all hospitals while national collaboration and single institution research declined slightly. Collaborative efforts correlated with higher impact scores, and international collaboration scored higher than national collaboration. A total of 60% of all non-academic hospitals’ publications were produced in collaboration with UMCs, whereas almost 30% of the UMCs’ publications were the result of such collaboration. Non-academic hospitals showed a higher rate of collaboration with the UMC that was nearest geographically, whereas TopCare hospitals prioritized expertise over geographical proximity within their specialized domains. Boundary work mechanisms adopted by TopCare hospitals included aligning research activities with organizational mindset (identity), bolstering research infrastructure (competence) and finding and mobilizing strategic partnerships with academic partners (power). These efforts aimed to establish credibility and attractiveness as collaboration partners. Conclusions: Research collaboration between non-academic hospitals and UMCs, particularly where this also involves international collaboration, pays off in terms of publications and impact. The TopCare hospitals used the program’s resources to perform boundary work aimed at becoming an attractive and credible collaboration partner for academia. Local factors such as research history, strategic domain focus, in-house expertise, patient flows, infrastructure and network relationships influenced collaboration dynamics within TopCare hospitals and between them and UMCs. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This study documents the past and present of English scholarship of Shuōwén jiězì, the most important masterpiece of classical Chinese philology and lexicography. In an attempt to investigate the current status (synchronically) and developmental trajectory (diachronically) of Shuōwén scholarship, this study surveyed the bibliographical, theoretical, methodological and thematic state of Shuōwén literature manifested in an analytical framework of six parameters (geographic distribution, publication outlets, citations, theoretical approaches, research methods and research strands) by adopting a thorough bibliometric analysis subsequent to meticulous coding in terms of these six parameters in Shuōwén scholarship. The results showed that Shuōwén scholarship has displayed distinctive distribution patterns and chronological trends along bibliographical, theoretical, methodological and thematic dimensions. Synchronically, the research output is regionally based, thematically restricted and qualitatively examined; diachronically, the research quality is fluctuating, though research quantity multiplies steadily. To look ahead, the study sketched a few directions for advancement of future research agendas: a more global profile of researchers, a larger degree of internationalization of the native circle, a wider disciplinary range, and increased specialization streamlined into data-driven approach to core issues of liùshū, bùshǒu and GPS (graphic-phonetic-semantic) of head graphs. The study is useful in portraying an overarching disciplinary landscape for Shuōwén research and providing the basic reference statistics for possible comparisons across classical Chinese studies and for more general conclusions about the state of scholarship on sinology. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: The World Health Organization has proposed that physical activity is a meaningful way to improve the quality of human life and reduce the probability of chronic non-communicable diseases and that humans should change their mindset from the actual effectiveness of physical activity in promoting health to the new view that “physical activity makes life more meaningful.” The introduction and development of physical literacy reveal the critical role of physical activity in improving human health and the importance of human initiative in physical activity for healthy development. Therefore, the objectives of this paper are (1) to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the literature on physical literacy, assessing the scope, frequency, and geographical distribution of research publications from various countries and institutions from 2015 to 2023; (2) to visualize keywords in articles on the topic of Physical literacy to analyze whether there is a link between physical literacy and health, and (3) based on the results of the visual analysis, we propose that proper health is built on the sense of physical literacy and further construct the circular path of physical literacy, physical activity, and physical health improvement. Methods: Using VOSviewer software v.1.6.18, this study searched the core collection of the Web of Science database from 2015 to April 15, 2023, using “physical literacy” as a keyword to explore the current international research on physical literacy. Results: A total of 3,446 articles were included, and a correlation map was derived based on the co-occurrence frequency of keywords, which showed that physical literacy was highly correlated with six concepts: health literacy, physical activity, health, children, adolescents, and prevention. Conclusion: Based on the analysis of literature visualization techniques, there is a high correlation between physical literacy and health, and international physical literacy research is in a trend of multi-point amplification, with research hotspots gradually shifting from the field of sports to the field of health and closely related to the field of health, indicating that physical literacy aims to promote the achievement of individual health by driving humans to increase physical activity. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This study aims to explore the research trends and patterns of major issues connecting climate change and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by employing a bibliometric analysis. The study has found that there is an increasing number of research and policies in various countries committed to finding and implementing strategies to solve climate change issues. The countries with the most research in this field are China, India, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, with Environmental Sciences & Ecology being the most published domain. The study has identified 19 clusters intersecting with climate change and SDGs, with the top five clusters in terms of proportion related to agricultural and food systems, water and soil resources, energy, economy, ecosystem, and sustainable management. This study also presents the trend changes of research topics intersecting climate change and SDGs every 2–3 years. Especially in the recent two years, with the convening of COP26 and COP27 and the advocacy of Net Zero and CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism) of the EU, important topics include renewable energy, protection of ecosystem services, life cycle assessment, food security, agriculture in Africa, sustainable management, synergies of various policies, remote sensing technology, and desertification among others. This shows an increasingly diversified range of important topics being discussed in relation to climate change and sustainable development goals. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This bibliometric review aims to identify key actors in the behavioral health services availability/accessibility literature. Coalescing information about these actors could support subsequent research efforts to improve the availability and accessibility of behavioral health services. The authors used a scoping review method and a bibliometric approach. The articles came from Medline, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. Articles were included if they assessed behavioral health service availability or accessibility quantitatively and were written in English. The final sample included 265 articles. Bibliometric data were extracted, coded, and verified. The authors analyzed the data using univariate and social network analyses. Publishing in this area has become more consistent and has grown since 2002. Psychiatric Services and Graduate Theses were the most frequently used publication venues. The National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institute of Mental Health, and the Veterans Administration funded the most research. The most frequently used keyword was “health services accessibility.” The findings suggest that this literature is growing. There are a few clusters of researchers in this area. Government organizations primarily fund this research. The paper and supplementary materials list the top researchers, publication venues, funding sources, and key terms to promote further behavioral health availability/accessibility research. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Data on the association between social isolation, loneliness, and risk of incident coronary heart disease (CVD) are conflicting. The objective of this study is to determine the relationship between social isolation and loneliness, and the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) in middle age and elderly using meta-analysis. The purpose of the bibliometric analysis is to systematically evaluate the existing literature on the relationship between social isolation, loneliness, and the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) in middle-aged and elderly individuals. A comprehensive search through four electronic databases (MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science) was conducted for published articles that determined the association between social isolation and/or loneliness and the risk of developing coronary heart disease from June 2015 to May 2023. Two independent reviewers reviewed the titles and abstracts of the records. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline to conduct the systematic review and meta-analysis. Data for the bibliometric analysis was obtained from the Scopus database and analyzed using VOSviewer and Bibliometrix applications. Six studies involving 104,511 patients were included in the final qualitative review and meta-analysis after screening the records. The prevalence of loneliness ranged from 5 to 65.3%, and social isolation ranged from 2 to 56.5%. A total of 5073 cardiovascular events were recorded after follow-up, ranging between 4 and 13 years. Poor social relationships were associated with a 16% increase in the risk of incident CVD (Hazard Ratio of new CVD when comparing high versus low loneliness or social isolation was 1.16 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.10–1.22). The bibliometric analysis shows a rapidly growing field (9.77% annual growth) with common collaboration (6.37 co-authors/document, 26.53% international). The US leads research output, followed by the UK and Australia. Top institutions include University College London, Inserm, and the University of Glasgow. Research focuses on "elderly," "cardiovascular disease," and "psychosocial stress," with recent trends in "mental health," "social determinants," and "COVID-19". Social isolation and loneliness increase the risk of and worsen outcomes in incident cardiovascular diseases. However, the observed effect estimate is small, and this may be attributable to residual confounding from incomplete measurement of potentially confounding or mediating factors. The results of the bibliometric analysis highlight the multidimensional nature of CVD research, covering factors such as social, psychological, and environmental determinants, as well as their interplay with various demographic and health-related variables. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The current work highlights the evolution in knowledge management for sustainable entrepreneurship research by analyzing the key trends and major concepts. Additionally, the knowledge structures of such research themes were analyzed and mapped. Moreover, this paper seeks to present a research agenda concerning the study subject. It employed an integrated bibliometric approach and systematic review of knowledge management and sustainable entrepreneurship research by conducting two main procedures, namely domain analysis (i.e., key trends and evolution) and knowledge structures analysis (i.e., intellectual, social, and conceptual structure). A total of 233 documents were obtained from Scopus and Web of Science datasets and analyzed using both R 4.1.2 and VOSviewer software. The findings demonstrated that the contributors (i.e., the authors, nations, journals, and institutions) produced a discernible evolution in the body of knowledge on the themes of knowledge management and sustainable business within the designated period. Furthermore, science mapping approaches deeply grasp the social, conceptual, and intellectual structures of such research themes. This current work is considered one of the first attempts to systematically review, analyze, and visualize the scientific productions on knowledge management and sustainable entrepreneurship. The findings of the current work also offer a solid understanding and insights into the potential directions for the research agenda in these disciplines. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) is defined as the restoration of blood flow to the myocardium after a brief interruption of blood supply, causing more severe damage to the ischemic myocardium. However, currently, reperfusion therapy is the preferred therapy for ischemic cardiomyopathy, which undoubtedly causes MIRI, and thus it has become a challenging issue affecting the prognosis of coronary artery disease. Methods: A search was conducted in the Web of Science Core Collection database for papers relevant to MIRI therapy published between 1 January 2000 and 1 October 2023. Bibliometric analyses were performed using VOSviewer and CiteSpace to elucidate the progress and hotspots. Results: 3304 papers from 64 countries, 2134 research institutions and 13,228 authors were enrolled in the study. Of these, China contributed the most papers and had the biggest impact, while the United States had the most extensive partnership. The Fourth Military Medical University was the primary research institution. The most valuable authors include Chattipakorn, Nipon, Chattipakorn, Siriporn c, Yang, Jian and Yang, Yang. Conclusion: Over the past 20 years, research on MIRI therapies has made significant strides. Further studies are necessary to explore the interactions between various therapeutic options. Future investigations will emphasize nanocarriers, cardiac regeneration, and stem cell therapies. Our study identifies MIRI research hotspots from a bibliometric perspective, forecasts future trends, and offers fresh insights into MIRI therapy research. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: A novel lytic bacteriophage (phage) was isolated with Pseudomonas mendocina strain STP12 (P. mendocina) from the untreated site of Sewage Treatment Plant of Lovely Professional University, India. P. mendocina is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, aerobic bacterium belonging to the family Pseudomonadaceae and has been reported in fifteen (15) cases of economically important diseases worldwide. Methods and results: Here, a novel phage specifically infecting and killing P. mendocina strain STP12 was isolated from sewage sample using enrichment, spot test and double agar overlay (DAOL) method and was designated as vB_PmeS_STP12. The phage vB-PmeS-STP12 was viable at wide range of pH and temperature ranging from 4 to10 and − 20 to 70 °C respectively. Host range and efficiency of plating (EOP) analysis indicated that phage vB-PmeS-STP12 was capable of infecting and killing P. mendocina strain STP6 with EOP of 0.34. Phage vB_PmeS_STP12 was found to have a significant bacterial reduction (p < 0.005) at all the doses administered, particularly at optimal MOI of 1 PFU/CFU, compared to the control. Morphological analysis using high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) revealed an icosahedral capsid of ~ 55 nm in diameter on average with a short, non-contractile tail. The genome of vB_PmeS_STP12 is a linear, dsDNA containing 36,212 bp in size with a GC content of 58.87% harbouring 46 open reading frames (ORFs). The 46 predicted ORFs encode proteins with functional information categorized as lysis, replication, packaging, regulation, assembly, infection, immune, and hypothetical. However, the genome of vB_PmeS_STP12 appeared to be devoid of tRNAs, integrase gene, toxins genes, virulence factors, antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and CRISPR arrays. The blast analysis with phylogeny revealed that vB_PmeS_STP12 is genetically similar to Pseudomonas phage PMBT14, Pseudomonas phage Almagne and Serratia phage Serbin with a highest identity of 74.00%, 74.93% and 59.48% respectively. Conclusions: Taken together, characterization, morphological analysis and genome-informatics indicated that vB_PmeS_STP12 is podovirus morphotype belonging to the class Caudoviticetes, family Zobellviridae which appeared to be devoid of integrase gene, ARGs, CRISPR arrays, virulence factors and toxins genes, exhibiting stability and infectivity at wide range of pH (4 to10) and temperature (–20 to 70 °C), thereby making vB_PmeS_STP12 suitable for phage therapy or biocontrol. Based on the bibliometric analysis and data availability with respect to sequences deposited in GenBank, this is the first report of a phage infecting Pseudomonas mendocina. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Countries all over the world have been seeking ways and methods so that their electrical matrices can stand out using clean and renewable energy sources. In this context, this article presents a review with analysis of sector legislation on photovoltaic solar energy in Brazil. This study was grounded in four steps: (i) sample definition; (ii) theoretical basis; (iii) network analysis; and (iv) content analysis in two stages of research. Initially, a systematic literature review was carried out in order to map all the major and most cited works. The second stage consisted in reading and performing a critical analysis of government documents and reports from the energy sector in Brazil using a few bibliometric resources for such a purpose. Its results reveal that photovoltaic solar energy in Brazil has grown and expanded to different applications, since floating solar plants and subscription to solar energy are becoming increasingly attractive. Furthermore, a possible replacement of photovoltaic solar generation for thermoelectric plants has been investigated once there are a few positive aspects yet to be found thereof. As samples of the results obtained, we have that the replacement of works would allow the photovoltaic solar energy source to increase by 1% in the electrical matrix and would stop emitting 10,738,478 tons into the atmosphere, there would be a progressive decrease in the use of tariff flags (which affect directly to the final consumer) and a reduction in operating costs would also be achieved. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Sexual selection has been a popular subject within evolutionary biology because of its central role in explaining odd and counterintuitive traits observed in nature. Consequently, the literature associated with this field of study became vast. Meta-analytical studies attempting to draw inferences from this literature have now accumulated, varying in scope and quality, thus calling for a synthesis of these syntheses. We conducted a systematic literature search to create a systematic map with a report appraisal of meta-analyses on topics associated with sexual selection, aiming to identify the conceptual and methodological gaps in this secondary literature. We also conducted bibliometric analyses to explore whether these gaps are associated with the gender and origin of the authors of these meta-analyses. We included 152 meta-analytical studies in our systematic map. We found that most meta-analyses focused on males and on certain animal groups (e.g. birds), indicating severe sex and taxonomic biases. The topics in these studies varied greatly, from proximate (e.g. relationship of ornaments with other traits) to ultimate questions (e.g. formal estimates of sexual selection strength), although the former were more common. We also observed several common methodological issues in these studies, such as lack of detailed information regarding searches, screening, and analyses, which ultimately impairs the reliability of many of these meta-analyses. In addition, most of the meta-analyses' authors were men affiliated to institutions from developed countries, pointing to both gender and geographical authorship biases. Most importantly, we found that certain authorship aspects were associated with conceptual and methodological issues in meta-analytical studies. Many of our findings might simply reflect patterns in the current state of the primary literature and academia, suggesting that our study can serve as an indicator of issues within the field of sexual selection at large. Based on our findings, we provide both conceptual and analytical recommendations to improve future studies in the field of sexual selection. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Interleukin17 (IL17) is an important cytokine in host defense at mucosal surfaces and also mediates many autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In recent years, many types of research relevant to the structure and function of IL17 have been identified. However, there is no bibliometric analysis in this research field. This study aims to explore the history, research hotspots, and emerging trends of IL17 from the perspective of the structure and function dynamics. Methods: Articles relevant to IL17 in the last two decades were retrieved through the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. The bibliometric analysis was performed by VOSview. Results: A total of 882 papers in this research were analyzed from 65 countries, and the rate of published articles has increased from 2008 annually, with the USA, China, and Germany leading the research effort. Frontiers in Immunology has significantly impacted research in this field and the University of Pittsburgh was the leading institution. Gaffen, Sarah L. from the University of Pittsburgh was the most productive researcher in this field and Papp Ka from the Probity Medical Research Incorporate of Canada is the most co-cited author. The analysis of keywords showed that inflammation, expression, Th17 cells, and cytokines were the main hotspots and frontier directions of IL17. The trend of clinical application in the future is the development of new therapy drugs based on the structure of IL17 or IL17 signaling pathway molecular. Conclusions: Our research summarized the developments and research trends of IL17 and would help researchers understand the research status of IL17 and provide a reference for future researchers as soon as possible. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This study aims to comprehensively review scientific journal articles related to the adjustment of international employees within the management and business domain from 1990 to 2022. The study seeks to identify trends and patterns in research topics and to propose a future research agenda. To achieve this, we analysed 222 articles from the Web of Science Core Collection database through two main steps: (1) a bibliometric analysis to track the field’s evolution over time and (2) a content analysis of abstracts to examine covered topics and pinpoint research gaps. Our findings indicate that the theory surrounding the adjustment of international employees is still in the process of maturation, with several potential areas for future research emerging. The analysis reveals that factors influencing adjustment are the most extensively researched for assigned expatriates, leaving other international employees relatively under-researched. Moreover, quantitative research emerged as the most prevalent methodological approach among the included studies. Most study samples predominantly consisted of individuals moving between Asia, Europe, and North America, underscoring the significance of Africa—characterised by substantial migration flows within the region—as a focal point for future adjustment research. Moreover, individual-, organisation-, and country-related antecedents of international employees’ anticipatory and in-country adjustments were analysed to present conclusions for future research. This study supplements the domains of international human resource management and international business by identifying research priorities concerning the adjustment of international employees and outlining an agenda for further research. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The research on immigrant integration is a dynamic interdisciplinary domain with rich and diverse literature. Considering the numerous studies in this domain, it is valuable to provide a comprehensive mapping to understand the research landscape resource and facilitate collaborations. This article combines Structural Topic modeling with bibliometric analysis to identify key research topics on immigrant integration. Applying these methods to 70890 abstracts published between 1960 and 2022, we identified 30 key research topics. We also tracked their prevalence over time, correlations and distributions within institutions and countries, funding effects, and countries’ collaborations. The results indicate that the most discussed topics are integration theory, economic integration, education, residential segregation, integration policy, language, religious diversity, cultural participation, identity & belonging, racism & discrimination, political participation, health & welfare, research methods, demographic issues, gender & violence. Moreover, some of these topics were highly prominent in earlier periods and nearly non-existent in later years, while others emerged only recently. Specific topics maintained consistent significance over time. Analyses of correlations and trends reveal clusters of topics and diverse distributions across countries and research institutions. The implications of these results can benefit researchers, helping them better understand the current state of research and design future research projects. The finding could also help stakeholders in migration and integration governance and funding agencies to guide policies regarding the integration of immigrants. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - In recent years, spatial transcriptomics (ST) research has become a popular field of study and has shown great potential in medicine. However, there are few bibliometric analyses in this field. Thus, in this study, we aimed to find and analyze the frontiers and trends of this medical research field based on the available literature. A computerized search was applied to the WoSCC (Web of Science Core Collection) Database for literature published from 2006 to 2023. Complete records of all literature and cited references were extracted and screened. The bibliometric analysis and visualization were performed using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, Bibliometrix R Package software, and Scimago Graphica. A total of 1467 papers and reviews were included. The analysis revealed that the ST publication and citation results have shown a rapid upward trend over the last 3 years. Nature Communications and Nature were the most productive and most co-cited journals, respectively. In the comprehensive global collaborative network, the United States is the country with the most organizations and publications, followed closely by China and the United Kingdom. The author Joakim Lundeberg published the most cited paper, while Patrik L. Ståhl ranked first among co-cited authors. The hot topics in ST are tissue recognition, cancer, heterogeneity, immunotherapy, differentiation, and models. ST technologies have greatly contributed to in-depth research in medical fields such as oncology and neuroscience, opening up new possibilities for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Moreover, artificial intelligence and big data drive additional development in ST fields. Graphical Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies and application prospects. (1) Imaging-based approaches, including in situ sequencing (ISS)—where transcripts are amplified and sequenced in tissue—and ISH-based approaches—where imaging probes are sequentially hybridized in tissue. (2) NGS-based techniques, in which positional information is encoded onto transcripts prior to NGS sequencing. (Figure presented.) © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Objective: Bibliometric analysis and citation counts help to acknowledge influence of publications. The aim of this study was to conduct bibliometric and citation analysis of top-cited articles, from low- and lower-middle income countries, on use and application of digital technology in dentistry. Methodology: A search strategy based on “Digital Dentistry”, “Low Income Countries”, and “Lower-Middle Income Countries” was used in October 2023 using Scopus database to retrieve articles relevant to digital dentistry, with citation count of 10 or more. From 44 included articles, bibliometric information was analyzed on SPSS version 23. Network analysis based on co-citations, keywords, and number of citations was conducted on VOS software (version 1.6.20). Results: Most relevant articles were published in 2021 (n = 8), with 52.3% original articles, out of which 40.9% were in vitro studies. India had the highest number of articles (n = 24), with most publications in The Journal of Indian Prosthodontic Society (n = 4), and in the domain of General Dentistry (n = 15, 34.1%). Co-authorship network analysis was not significant, but country-wise co-authorship analysis revealed India with the greatest link strength (4.0). Highest occurring keyword was 3D printing (link strength 5.0), and the citation analysis revealed Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry with the most number of published documents (3), having a citation count of 275. Bibliographic coupling for sources revealed Journal of Indian Prosthodontic Society to have the highest link strength of 15.33. Conclusion: This analysis uncovers interesting bibliometric and citation based information including key thematic trends, emphasizing crucial role of technologies like 3D printing, CAD/CAM, and CBCT in digital dentistry. The study underscores the imperative for increased original research efforts in low- and lower middle-income countries. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Glioblastoma is a common and aggressive malignant central nervous system tumor in adults. This study aims to evaluate and analyze the scientific results, collaboration countries, main research topics, and topics over time reported about glioblastoma. A bibliometric analysis of glioblastoma publications was performed mainly using R and Multbiplot software for author, journal, and resume. Associated statistic methods Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and HJ-Biplot. Inclusion criteria were research articles from the PubMed database published in English between 1973 and December 2022. A total of 64,823 documents with an annual growth rate of 8.27% indicates a consistent increase in research output over time. The results for the number of citations and significant publications showed Cancer Res, J Neuro-Oncol, and Neuro-Oncology are the most influential journals in the field of glioblastoma. The countries that concentrated research were the tumor United States, China, Germany, and Italy. Finally, there has been a marked growth in studies on prognosis and patient survival, therapies, and treatments for glioblastoma. These findings reinforce the need for increased global resources to address glioblastoma, particularly in underdeveloped countries. Glioblastoma research’s exponential growth reflects sustained interest in early diagnosis and patient survival. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to perform a bibliometric analysis centered on recent advancements in injury prevention for female athletes. Methods: The study employed Excel, VOSviewer, and the bibliometric R-package tools to analyze and evaluate relevant records obtained from the Web of Science (WOS) database, using a reliable search methodology. Results: From the WOS database, a collection of 10 560 scientific records was acquired using specific keywords, covering the period between 2010 and 2023. These records were subjected to content analysis, revealing the prevalent themes in this research area. Noteworthy topics included risk, risk factors, prevention, women, exercise, physical activity, epidemiology, injuries, performance, injury, strength, and health. The investigation also indicated that the journals “American journal of sports medicine” and “journal of athletic training” demonstrated the highest level of activity in this field. Regarding research productivity, developed countries, such as the United States and Canada stood out as the most prolific contributors. Moreover, the study recognized Gregory D Myer as the most active author in this area. Conclusion: The convergence of injury prevention in female athletes continues to be a subject of significant research attention. This study highlights that the bulk of the literature on this subject originates from researchers in developed countries. However, it is crucial to recognize that a substantial segment of the global population, particularly in developing nations, lacks sufficient representation in research related to early life psychology concerning exercise and physical activity. © 2024, University of Social Welfare and Rehabilitation Sciences.

AB  - Climate change (CC) will likely significantly impact the world’s infrastructure significantly. Rising temperatures, increased precipitation, and rising sea levels are all likely to stress critical infrastructures (CI). Rising temperatures can lead to infrastructure damage from extreme heat events. This can cause roads and bridges to buckle or crack, leading to costly repairs and potential traffic disruptions. In addition, heat waves can damage vital electrical infrastructure, leading to widespread power outages. In light of this context, this article reports on a study which examined the connections and impacts of CC on infrastructure. The study employed a mixed-method approach, combining bibliometric analysis for the period 1997–2022 with a series of relevant case studies from the five continents to offer insight into the impact of CC on infrastructure. The article fills a research gap in respect of assessments of the extent to which climate change (CC) negative influences the infrastructure, with a special focus on developing countries. It also showcases CI projects and adaptation measures being currently deployed, to address CC. The results show that the current infrastructure is vulnerable to CC. The selected case studies on CI adaptation show that in developing and industrialised countries, there is a perceived need to understand better the connections and potential impacts of CC on critical areas such as transport, settlements, and coastal infrastructure. In order to protect infrastructure from CC impacts, governments need to invest in measures such as flood control, early warning systems, and improved building codes. Additionally, they need to work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions more actively, which are the primary cause of CC. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: Herbal nanoparticles are made from natural herbs/medicinal plants, their extracts, or a combination with other nanoparticle carriers. Compared to traditional herbs, herbal nanoparticles lead to improved bioavailability, enhanced stability, and reduced toxicity. Previous research indicates that herbal medicine nanomaterials are rapidly advancing and making significant progress; however, bibliometric analysis and knowledge mapping for herbal nanoparticles are currently lacking. We performed a bibliometric analysis by retrieving publications related to herbal nanoparticles from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database spanning from 2004 to 2023. Data processing was performed using the R package Bibliometrix, VOSviewers, and CiteSpace. Results: In total, 1876 articles related to herbal nanoparticles were identified, originating from various countries, with China being the primary contributing country. The number of publications in this field increases annually. Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Saveetha University in India are prominent research institutions in this domain. The Journal “International Journal of Nanomedicine” has the highest number of publications. The number of authors of these publications reached 8234, with Yan Zhao, Yue Zhang, and Huihua Qu being the most prolific authors and Yan Zhao being the most frequently cited author. “Traditional Chinese medicine,” “drug delivery,” and “green synthesis” are the main research focal points. Themes such as “green synthesis,” “curcumin,” “wound healing,” “drug delivery,” and “carbon dots” may represent emerging research areas. Conclusions: Our study findings assist in identifying the latest research frontiers and hot topics, providing valuable references for scholars investigating the role of nanotechnology in herbal medicine.

AB  - Schizophrenia, a multifaceted mental disorder characterized by disturbances in thought, perception, and emotion, has been extensively investigated through resting-state fMRI, uncovering changes in spontaneous brain activity among those affected. However, a bibliometric examination regarding publication trends in resting-state fMRI studies related to schizophrenia is lacking. This study obtained relevant publications from the Web of Science Core Collection spanning the period from 1998 to 2022. Data extracted from these publications included information on countries/regions, institutions, authors, journals, and keywords. The collected data underwent analysis and visualization using VOSviewer software. The primary analyses included examination of international and institutional collaborations, authorship patterns, co-citation analyses of authors and journals, as well as exploration of keyword co-occurrence and temporal trend networks. A total of 859 publications were retrieved, indicating an overall growth trend from 1998 to 2022. China and the United States emerged as the leading contributors in both publication outputs and citations, with Central South University and the University of New Mexico being identified as the most productive institutions. Vince D. Calhoun had the highest number of publications and citation counts, while Karl J. Friston was recognized as the most influential author based on co-citations. Key journals such as Neuroimage, Schizophrenia Research, Schizophrenia Bulletin, and Biological Psychiatry played pivotal roles in advancing this field. Recent popular keywords included support vector machine, antipsychotic medication, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and related terms. This study systematically synthesizes the historical development, current status, and future trends in resting-state fMRI research in schizophrenia, offering valuable insights for future research directions. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Trust, safety, and quality are among the most important factors in the agri-food supply chains. Traceability is a powerful tool to ensure them, but implementing a transparent and effective system is a complex operation. As a result, innovative systems, like blockchain, could be introduced. Although research on its impacts in the agri-food is recent, the literature appears fragmented. The objective is to investigate the studied aspects of the blockchain adoption in agri-food, with the purpose of retrieving meaningful considerations about the current state of the art about strategic high-value supply chains, such as wine and olive oil, particularly subjected to fraudulent behaviors. A productivity measurement was applied to retrieve the evolution of the number of documents through the years, the most productive countries, the sources, the research areas, and the most significant papers in terms of number of citations received. To understand the research trends, a co-occurrence analysis was employed. Results show that most of the existing studies focus on the role of blockchain in the resolution of some critical issues as food safety and frauds. While wine is currently an emerging sector in which this approach can be implemented, olive oil still needs more attention. In both cases, blockchain could potentially help to support the profitability and sustainability of the production. The research underlines the importance of focusing on the environmental and social dimension of the blockchain phenomenon and the use of technology to improve the efficiency of agri-food chains and reduce waste and resource use. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Purpose: This bibliometric analysis of the top 100 cited articles on extended reality (XR) in neurosurgery aimed to reveal trends in this research field. Gender differences in authorship and global distribution of the most-cited articles were also addressed. Methods: A Web of Science electronic database search was conducted. The top 100 most-cited articles related to the scope of this review were retrieved and analyzed for trends in publications, journal characteristics, authorship, global distribution, study design, and focus areas. After a brief description of the top 100 publications, a comparative analysis between spinal and cranial publications was performed. Results: From 2005, there was a significant increase in spinal neurosurgery publications with a focus on pedicle screw placement. Most articles were original research studies, with an emphasis on augmented reality (AR). In cranial neurosurgery, there was no notable increase in publications. There was an increase in studies assessing both AR and virtual reality (VR) research, with a notable emphasis on VR compared to AR. Education, surgical skills assessment, and surgical planning were more common themes in cranial studies compared to spinal studies. Female authorship was notably low in both groups, with no significant increase over time. The USA and Canada contributed most of the publications in the research field. Conclusions: Research regarding the use of XR in neurosurgery increased significantly from 2005. Cranial research focused on VR and resident education while spinal research focused on AR and neuronavigation. Female authorship was underrepresented. North America provides most of the high-impact research in this area. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Students are central actors at Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Whereas much can be achieved by the active participation of students in sustainability affairs, it is unclear what is the current level of students’ knowledge and engagement regarding the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) around the world, as well as which initiatives are being undertaken by HEIs on this matter. In order to address this research gap, this study investigated the current status of students’ knowledge and participation in initiatives aimed at the implementation of the UN SDGs. A comprehensive research methodology was carried out by means of a bibliometric analysis, case studies, and a survey involving a sample of 602 students from 53 countries. For the bibliometric analysis, data were analysed with the support of the VOSviewer software, while quantitative data analysis was performed with the support of IBM SPSS Statistics. The study shows that the participation of students in SDGs activities is associated with the commitment level of the HEIs to the implementation of the SDGs. In addition, the fact that students have taken a course or have a discipline related to the SDGs, plays a significant role in the SDGs implementation process. Moreover, the findings reveal that graduate students are more familiar with the SDGs than their undergraduate peers. The analysed HEIs case studies also demonstrate the commitment to sustainable development (SD) through different initiatives being pursued at different levels and scopes. Based on the results, the study provides recommendations on a set of specific measures that may be implemented to increase HEIs students’ interest and engagement in SD. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Educational strategies have undergone significant transformations in an era marked by rapid globalization, advancements in communication technologies, and challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic. Amid these changes, Citizen Science (CS) has gained prominence as an innovative educational approach, particularly in fostering complex thinking skills necessary to navigate contemporary global trends. This study aims to fill the knowledge gap regarding the effectiveness of CS projects in developing complex thinking competencies within higher education. Through a bibliometric analysis of 28 Scopus-indexed articles from 2000 to 2022, this research maps the landscape of CS as an educational strategy and evaluates its alignment with complex thinking development. The analysis indicates a strong link between CS projects and the enhancement of complex thinking and its sub-competencies. It demonstrates that CS initiatives have successfully achieved their educational objectives, substantially enriching the learning experience. Furthermore, the research highlights a growing trend in applying CS for educational purposes. These findings suggest that CS can be a valuable component of higher education curricula, offering a practical method for developing critical competencies in students. The study underscores the potential of CS to contribute meaningfully to the evolution of pedagogical practices and provides a foundation for future research to build upon, particularly in the context of higher education’s response to global educational demands. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - In the current era, a new class of lightweight, silent, and all-electric aircraft that can take off and land vertically is about to transform mobility in major urban centers. Safer and quieter than helicopters, and operating in some cases without a pilot, they can supplement land mobility. Indeed, urban air mobility (UAM) has recently been a hot topic for debate and scientific research. However, it requires new types of service and technology and a novel business model. For a successful implementation, this paper provides the most insightful knowledge and actors, focusing on demand assessment through current research advancements in the area of urban air mobility. For that purpose, bibliometric analysis has been conducted, using a four-step methodology based on the search of the most frequently used keywords. The research work investigated the needs of the main stakeholders and illustrated how UAM can mitigate the pressure put on decision-makers regarding the mobility demand. The results show recent trends in scientific publications and citations, most cited articles, countries, and organizations that are more involved in this research subject, keyword co-co-occurrence analysis to identify and analyze current research areas and their associated barriers and challenges, using the VOSviewer software and WoS analytic feature. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The improper management of wastewater has become a pressing global environmental issue, demanding immediate attention from the scientific community. A significant concern arises from the increasing presence of “emerging contaminants (ECs),” synthetic compounds detected in minute concentrations across diverse environmental matrices. Recent reports emphasize the prevalence of ECs in wastewater due to unregulated discharges of pharmaceuticals, drugs, endocrine disruptors, pesticides, and various pollutants. The widespread distribution and impact of ECs underscore the necessity for effective removal strategies. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of sustainable wastewater treatment techniques, evaluating their effectiveness and long-term viability. Employing bibliometric analyses on 2785 research papers published between 2016 and 2023 from databases like Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Google Scholar, the study reveals Asia, Europe, and North America as major contributors to global EC prevalence. The paper thoroughly assesses experimental conditions and performance of various treatment methods, focusing on phase-changing techniques like membrane processes, adsorption onto solid substrates, advanced oxidation, and biological treatments for removing 55 + different ECs. Among the notable approaches, hybrid constructed wetlands emerge as a sustainable solution, demonstrating enhanced effectiveness. The review also addresses practical challenges, including cost-effectiveness and scalability, while exploring the social and economic repercussions of ECs and their treatment. By consolidating insights from diverse sources, this paper serves as valuable resources for researchers aiming to mitigate the adverse effects of ECs on the environment and human health.

AB  - Entrepreneurship is vital for economic growth and development, as it fosters innovation, creates jobs, and enhances competition and competitiveness. At the same time, in contemporary society, where the Internet has assumed the role of the primary instrument for both communication and commerce, effective utilisation of vast amounts of data has become imperative for businesses, especially in the entrepreneurial environment. To identify the main connections in two of the currently most trending concepts in business, we undertook a systematic literature review focusing on Big Data, entrepreneurship, and their interconnections in business management through 301 research documents. While numerous studies have already delved individually into Big Data and entrepreneurship, the interconnection between these concepts still has research potential. Our results reflect a growing interest in leading research on these topics, with specific leading authors and countries. Furthermore, we show and discuss a conceptual map consisting of five clusters, unveiling interesting connections such as the impact of blockchain on firms, the correlation between Big Data and firm performance, the role of data science, and the significance of Big Data analytics for operational performance. The article ends by examining how Big Data and entrepreneurship change the business landscape. While entrepreneurs use data for decision-making, innovation, and tailored customer experiences, there are lingering concerns such as data security and privacy. The future of business and innovation will depend, in part, on the crossroads between entrepreneurs and Big Data technologies. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This study delves into the pivotal role that indicators play in designing, assessing, and guiding policies for sustainable urban development. Indicators, encompassing both quantitative and qualitative measures, serve as essential tools in evaluating efforts toward sustainable development, providing a practical and objective means of understanding the complex urban environment. The lack of a robust database is identified as a hindrance to monitoring sustainable development progress, underscoring the importance of comprehensive indicators. The study employs a bibliometric literature review methodology, focusing on smart city and sustainability indicators (SSCI) from 2015 to 2022. A total of 818 articles were narrowed down to 191 through rigorous criteria. The study showcases a growing interest in this field, with the number of articles published experiencing a remarkable 288% increase from 2015 to 2022. China emerges as a focal point, leading in both article production and citations, emphasizing its commitment to sustainable development and smart city initiatives. The keywords "sustainable development", "sustainability" and “urban development” had the most occurrences in text analysis. We found three different clusters with k-means analysis, and the circular economy indicators were the most representative category. In conclusion, the study underscores the holistic vision of SSCI in the current scenario, balancing technology and sustainability to improve urban quality of life while safeguarding the planet. Encouraging further research into integrating resilience-focused indicators and innovative solutions is crucial for enhancing sustainable urban development and informing policy decisions. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Purpose: Improvement of patient care is associated with increasing publication numbers in biomedical research. However, such increasing numbers of publications make it challenging for physicians and scientists to screen and process the literature of their respective fields. In this study, we present a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the evolution of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) research, analyzing the current state of the field and identifying key open questions going beyond the recent advantages for future studies to assess. Methods: Using the Web of Science Core Collection, 5040 GIST-associated publications in the years 1984–2022 were identified and analyzed regarding key bibliometric variables using the Bibliometrix R package and VOSviewer software. Results: GIST-associated publication numbers substantially increased over time, accentuated from year 2000 onwards, and being characterized by multinational collaborations. The main topic clusters comprise surgical management, tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) development/treatment, diagnostic workup, and molecular pathophysiology. Within all main topic clusters, a significant progress is reflected by the literature over the years. This progress ranges from conventional open surgical techniques over minimally invasive, including robotic and endoscopic, resection techniques to increasing identification of specific functional genetic aberrations sensitizing for newly developed TKIs being extensively investigated in clinical studies and implemented in GIST treatment guidelines. However, especially in locally advanced, recurrent, and metastatic disease stages, surgery-related questions and certain specific questions concerning (further-line) TKI treatment resistance were infrequently addressed. Conclusion: Increasing GIST-related publication numbers reflect a continuous progress in the major topic clusters of the GIST research field. Especially in advanced disease stages, questions related to the interplay between surgical approaches and TKI treatment sensitivity should be addressed in future studies. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The maritime sector has evolved as a crucial link in countries' economic development. Given that most of the trade across regions takes place through naval transportation, the performance of the seaports has been one of the focus areas of research. As the publication volume has significantly grown in the recent past, this study critically examines the publications related to the performance of ports for exploring the evolution, identifying the trends of articles, and analyzing the citations covering the publications based on relevant keywords in Scopus database for the period 1975–April 2024. Bibliometric and scientometric analysis was done using R, Python, and VOS software tools. Results indicate the core subject areas as “port efficiency”, “data envelopment analysis” (DEA), “port competitiveness”, “simulation”, “port governance”, and “sustainability,” with "sustainability" as the most discussed and highly relevant theme that has evolved in the last five years. Bibliometric data analysis on the subject area, yearly trends, top journals of publications, citation and author analysis, impact analysis, country-wise publication, and thematic analysis with clusters are also performed to outline future research directions. The analysis indicates an exponential rise in publications in recent times and with sustainability-related studies gaining more importance, especially for empirical research on port performance and demands for future empirical research on sustainability and smart port performance subject area. The study's findings are helpful for researchers, academicians, policymakers, and industry practitioners working towards a sustainable maritime port industry. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Smallholder farmers, crucial to global food security, face challenges in sustainable integration into agricultural innovation due to inherent flaws in existing finance models. This research addresses the conspicuous gap in comprehensive reviews on sustainable finance in agriculture through a bibliometric approach. Financial constraints, limited market access, and climate vulnerability plague smallholder farmers, hindering the long-term sustainability of current financial models. This study aims to systematically map the scholarly landscape of sustainable finance models for smallholder farmers, focusing on the adoption of agricultural innovations. A critical knowledge gap exists regarding bibliometric patterns and trends in the adoption of agricultural innovations by smallholder farmers. The study utilizes the RAPID framework for a streamlined and evidence-based bibliometric review, employing RStudio and the bibliometrix-package. The analysis aims to recognize, assess, purge, investigate, and document key themes and emerging patterns in the literature. Noteworthy trends from bibliometric reviews indicate a rise in bibliometric approaches, with VOSviewer as a prevalent tool. This research contributes methodologically by advocating for Scopus as the primary database. The study’s significance lies in informing policy, practice, and research initiatives supporting smallholder farmers. By revealing bibliometric patterns, this study aims to guide the design of innovative and context-specific financial instruments, fostering a more sustainable and inclusive agricultural landscape. In conclusion, this research endeavors to bridge the knowledge gap and provide novel insights at the intersection of sustainable finance and agricultural innovation adoption. The anticipated outcomes will inform the development of tailored financial models, advancing the resilience and productivity of smallholder farmers globally. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The paper aims to systematically review the literature that empirically investigates the relationship between feminisms and entrepreneurship. Feminisms, meant as movements, cultures, collective identities embedded with values and beliefs, could indeed contribute to challenge patriarchal gender norms that dominate the entrepreneurial world, so allowing new forms and narratives of business to emerge. To achieve the paper goal, a systematic literature review protocol is developed and the most prominent scientific research databases are queried. After a bibliometric framing of the retrieved papers, content analysis is adopted to identify the theoretical and methodological approaches, relevant topics and research gaps. Despite a considerable inhomogeneity in definitions, topics, and theoretical framings, the study shows that most papers agree on recognizing the crucial role of feminisms in: (i) women's entrepreneurial empowerment, especially in traditionally male-dominated cultural and geographical contexts and (ii) challenging the neoliberal paradigm. The study also inductively derives a definition of feminist entrepreneur, proposing an ontology that illustrates its relationship to the concepts of entrepreneurship, feminism and entrepreneurial feminist. From a managerial perspective, the study highlights similarities and differences among heterogeneous entrepreneurial experiences, thus unveiling feminist entrepreneurship features potentially useful for policy makers, educators, and practitioners. On the societal level, the research contributes to spreading knowledge about a phenomenon arguably disruptive in enhancing the inclusiveness of traditional entrepreneurial ecosystems. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Given the unpredictability and complexity of the business environment -due to the Fourth Industrial Revolution and augmented by the COVID-19 pandemic-, employees are required to continually learn new skills and ways of working. Even though 20 years have passed since the coining of the learning agility (LA) construct, only one literature review has explored it qualitatively. Through a co-word bibliometric analysis, complemented by a content analysis, this paper aims to identify the intellectual structure of the LA. Results show that the scientific production by research areas, journals, and studies that have contributed most to the field. Career variety was found as a central and underdeveloped theme while Talent Management was identified as potential emergent one. The important themes for structuring the field on LA were mostly examined from an individual level, as a process or as an outcome. Future research within the Human Resource Development field is suggested. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Purpose: This study sought to provide an overview of the current research and further analyze publication trends in the field of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and anti-VEGF treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NVAMD). Methods: We downloaded all related publications from 2001 to 2020 from the Web of Science Core Collection and conducted a bibliometric analysis using the bibiometrix package in R programming software. Results: A total of 3717 publications were included in the analysis. The USA contributed the largest number of publications (1443), and achieved the highest number of citations (74,946) and H-index value (28). Johns Hopkins University, USA, was the top institution with the most publications, and Peter A. Campochiaro was the most productive professor at The Wilmer Eye Institute, USA. 9.60% of the total publications were from the Journal of Retinal and Vitreous Diseases. Trend analysis demonstrated that anti-VEGF therapy was introduced in early 2000 after steroids, and the last 2 decades have witnessed the blossom of several anti-VEGF agents. “Treat-and-extend” and “resistance” were two popular trend topics in recent years. Conclusions: The USA occupies a dominant position in the research field of VEGF and anti-VEGF treatments in NVAMD. Steroid administration, photodynamic therapy, and anti-VEGF therapy have been pivotal advances in the treatment of NVAMD patients over the past 2 decades. Limited acting period and resistance are potential investigation directions in future studies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Background: The recurrent mental illness bipolar disorder is a major burden on the healthcare system, which underlines the importance of research into this disease. Germany is one of the most productive countries in this research activity. This bibliometric analysis aims to outline the social and conceptual structure of the German research landscape on bipolar disorder over the last decade. Furthermore, we provide a short overview over current public funding. Results: Concerning the social structure, most of the German publications were collaboration projects, both with a national but also international orientation, in the latter case predominantly with countries of the global North. Analysis of the conceptual structure of German research activity identified psychiatric genetics, early recognition of bipolar disorder, neuroimaging, and pharmacological interventions as important topics within the field. In the context of a survey, only few publicly funded research projects were reported, many of which did not exclusively investigate bipolar disorder but followed a transdiagnostic approach. Conclusions: Our bibliometric analysis revealed internationally well-networked German research activities on bipolar disorder. In stark contrast to its high prevalence and correspondingly high financial burden to the healthcare system, current grant support for research on this illness is strikingly low, particularly concerning the development of novel treatments. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Purpose: Lateral interbody fusion (LIF) is an increasingly popular minimally-invasive spine procedure. This study identifies notable trends in LIF literature and provides a detailed review of the bibliometric aspects of the top 100 most-cited articles. Methods: Articles were queried from the Web of Science database. Inclusion criteria consisted of peer-reviewed articles, full-text availability, and LIF focus. Network analysis including co-authorship mapping and bibliographic coupling were complemented by trend analysis to determine prominent contributors and themes. Analyses were conducted using VOSviewer and Bibliometrix (RStudio). Results: There has been a rapid increase in LIF publication and citation count since 1998. Leading journals were Spine (n = 24), Journal of Neurosurgery Spine (n = 22), and European Spine Journal (n = 12). NuVasive funded the most publications (n = 17), followed by DePuy Synthes Spine (n = 4). The United States was the most represented country (n = 81); however, trend analysis suggests a steadily growing international contribution. The most prolific author was J.S. Uribe (n = 16), followed by a tie in second place by E. Dakwar and L. Pimenta (n = 8). The most frequent keywords, “complication” (n = 34), “surgery” (n = 30), and “outcomes” (n = 24), demonstrated a patient-centric theme. Conclusions: This bibliometric analysis provides in-depth insights into the evolution and trends of LIF over the last two decades. The trends and themes identified demonstrate the innovative, collaborative, and patient-focused characteristics of this subfield. Future researchers can use this as a foundation for understanding the past and present state of LIF research while designing investigations. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Neuromyelitis optica is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that differs from multiple sclerosis. Over the past 20 years, the search for biomarkers for neuromyelitis optica has been ongoing. Here, we used a bibliometric approach to analyze the main research focus in the field of biomarkers for neuromyelitis optica. Research in this area is consistently increasing, with China and the United States leading the way on the number of studies conducted. The Mayo Clinic is a highly reputable institution in the United States, and was identified as the most authoritative institution in this field. Furthermore, Professor Wingerchuk from the Mayo Clinic was the most authoritative expert in this field. Keyword analysis revealed that the terms 'neuromyelitis optica' (261 times), 'multiple sclerosis' (220 times), 'neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder' (132 times), 'aquaporin 4' (99 times), and 'optical neuritis' (87 times) were the most frequently used keywords in literature related to this field. Comprehensive analysis of the classical literature showed that the majority of publications provide conclusive research evidence supporting the use of aquaporin-4-IgG and neuromyelitis optica-IgG to effectively diagnose and differentiate neuromyelitis optica from multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, aquaporin-4-IgG has emerged as a highly specific diagnostic biomarker for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-IgG is a diagnostic biomarker for myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-Associated disease. Recent biomarkers for neuromyelitis optica include cerebrospinal fluid immunological biomarkers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein, serum astrocyte damage biomarkers like FAM19A5, serum albumin, and gamma-Aminobutyric acid. The latest prospective clinical trials are exploring the potential of these biomarkers. Preliminary results indicate that glial fibrillary acidic protein is emerging as a promising candidate biomarker for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. The ultimate goal of future research is to identify non-invasive biomarkers with high sensitivity, specificity, and safety for the accurate diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica. © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

AB  - Background: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly recognized as a significant health issue. Emerging research has focused on the role of the gut microbiota in NAFLD, emphasizing the gut-liver axis. This study aimed to identify key research trends and guide future investigations in this evolving area. Methods: This bibliometric study utilized Scopus to analyze global research on the link between the gut microbiota and NAFLD. The method involved a search strategy focusing on relevant keywords in article titles, refined by including only peer-reviewed journal articles. The data analysis included bibliometric indicators such as publication counts and trends, which were visualized using VOSviewer software version 1.6.20 for network and co-occurrence analysis, highlighting key research clusters and emerging topics. Results: Among the 479 publications on the gut microbiota and NAFLD, the majority were original articles (n = 338; 70.56%), followed by reviews (n = 119; 24.84%). The annual publication count increased from 1 in 2010 to 118 in 2022, with a significant growth phase starting in 2017 (R2 = 0.9025, p < 0.001). The research was globally distributed and dominated by China (n = 231; 48.23%) and the United States (n = 90; 18.79%). The University of California, San Diego, led institutional contributions (n = 18; 3.76%). Funding was prominent, with 62.8% of the articles supported, especially by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (n = 118; 24.63%). The average citation count was 43.23, with an h-index of 70 and a citation range of 0 to 1058 per article. Research hotspots shifted their focus post-2020 toward the impact of high-fat diets on NAFLD incidence. Conclusions: This study has effectively mapped the growing body of research on the gut microbiota-NAFLD relationship, revealing a significant increase in publications since 2017. There is significant interest in gut microbiota and NAFLD research, mainly led by China and the United States, with diverse areas of focus. Recently, the field has moved toward exploring the interconnections among diet, lifestyle, and the gut-liver axis. We hypothesize that with advanced technologies, new opportunities for personalized medicine and a holistic understanding of NAFLD will emerge. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Hormesis, an adaptive response, occurs when exposure to low doses of a stressor potentially induces a stimulatory effect, while higher doses may inhibit it. This phenomenon is widely observed across various organisms and stressors, significantly advancing our understanding and inspiring further exploration of the beneficial effects of toxins at doses both below and beyond traditional thresholds. This has profound implications for promoting biological regulation at the cellular level and enhancing adaptability throughout the biosphere. Therefore, conducting bibliometric analysis in this field is crucial for accurately analyzing and summarizing its current research status. The results of the bibliometric analysis reveal a steady increase in the number of publications in this field over the years. The United States emerges as the leading country in both publication and citation numbers, with the journal Dose–Response publishing the highest number of papers in this area. Calabrese E.J. is a prominent person with significant contributions and influence among authors. Through keyword co-occurrence and trend analysis, current hotspots in this field are identified, primarily focusing on the relationship between hormesis, oxidative stress, and aging. Analysis of highly cited references predicts that future research trends may center around the relationship between hormesis and stress at different doses, as well as exploring the mechanisms and applications of hormesis. In conclusion, this review aims to visually represent hormesis-related research through bibliometric methods, uncovering emerging patterns and areas of focus within the field. It provides a summary of the current research status and forecasts trends in hormesis-related research. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Laser lithotripsy is gaining global prominence and is a dynamically progressing field marked by a continual influx of new and comprehensive research each year. Recently, there has been a noticeable shift toward the adoption of various kinds of lasers, such as holmium: yttrium–aluminum-garnet (Ho:YAG) and thulium fiber (TFL) lasers. Consequently, we aim to conduct a bibliometric analysis to analyze key areas of research activity within scientific publications that center on the utilization of laser techniques in urolithiasis. A search of the literature spanning from 1978 to 2022 was carried out on 25 December 2023 using the Scopus database to explore research related to the application of laser techniques for urolithiasis treatment. Visualization analysis was performed using VOSviewer software (version 1.6.20). We examined 962 publications that met the specified criteria, 791 (82.22%) of which were original articles. The analysis of the retrieved publications indicated a consistent increase in research output from 1978 to 2022; a particularly noteworthy surge occurred after 2003. In particular, the U.S. claimed the leading position as the most productive country, contributing 211 articles (21.93%). However, India had the highest research productivity according to the adjustment index of 19.08. In the European region, 324 publications (33.68% of the total) originated from 25 countries. The Journal of Endourology contributed the most between 1978 and 2022 (n = 96, 9.98%). The most cited paper examined the effectiveness of holmium: yttrium–aluminum-garnet (Ho:YAG) lasers, while a subsequent study focused on the use of a thulium fiber laser (TFL), an emerging laser technology that has gained increased recognition. Co-occurrence analysis revealed three distinct clusters focusing on the types of laser technology, minimally invasive approaches, and success rate/postoperative complications. This comprehensive investigation delves into the global landscape of laser use for the treatment of urolithiasis. This review supports the emerging clinical concept of using various types of laser technology for urolithiasis treatment. Moreover, the hot issues that researchers should focus on based on the findings of this study are the use of different types of laser lithotripsy in view of the surgical approach, success rate and complications. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The digital transformation of education should be continuously promoted to guarantee its sustainable development. Extensive research has been conducted in this field but has not comprehensively addressed Chinese education digitalization. To fill this research gap, discover the gaps between Chinese and international research on the digitization of education and provide well-founded, innovative ideas for future research, we perform a bibliometric analysis of knowledge mapping in Chinese education digitalization. WOS and CNKI databases were used to gather literature on Chinese education digitalization research from 2012 to 2022. CiteSpace was used to draw a knowledge map of Chinese education digitalization research through co-occurrence analysis of core authors, issuing institutions and regions and cluster analysis and burst terms analysis of keywords, combined with intensive manual studying of the literature. The results show the research status and hot spots of Chinese education digitalization research are divided into four dimensions: studies of lifelong education research in digital open universities and the online teaching transformation in higher education; studies of digital educational publications, the development and application of digital learning resources in vocational colleges and universities, and the equity of basic education resources in the digital context; studies on artificial intelligence technology empowering the digital transformation of education in China; and studies of digital integration of production and teaching in rural revitalization and improvement of digital literacy of university students and faculty. Future digital education research trends in China are likely to focus on the normalization of online education; the development of online education resources in the context of new infrastructure; “new technology plus education”; the impact of digital games on education; a more diversified digital divide in education; and digital rights, digital ethics, digital maturity and the Global Digital Education Development Index. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The relevance of entrepreneurial ecosystems in fostering economic growth has led to a recent surge in scholarship on the topic. We investigate the literature to provide researchers with a bird’s-eye view extant entrepreneurial ecosystem research, with the goal of communicating the nature of the field and opportunities it presents. Specifically, we analyze 380 articles extracted from the Scopus database to reveal the structure of entrepreneurial ecosystem knowledge and determine the top contributors (authors, institutions, countries, journals, and articles). We identify key knowledge clusters and influential articles through methods including the cooccurrence of author’s keywords and PageRank analysis. The four identified knowledge clusters are: (1) configuration and crucial dimensions of entrepreneurial ecosystems, (2) entrepreneurship for sustainability and circular economy, (3) building an innovation-driven ecosystem, and (4) knowledge, technology, and commercialization. Finally, we advise aspiring researchers in the entrepreneurship arena to explore the numerous avenues into which they may invest their efforts. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Background: Diabetes is a metabolic disorder posing a global threat to health. Many scholars are dedicated to developing non-pharmacological therapies, and mindfulness intervention is among the potentially effective approaches. Due to the rapid increase in relevant research in recent years, along with the diverse focus and interventions used in studies, it has become challenging for practitioners to quickly comprehend the key features of this field and the directions worth paying attention to. Bibliometric analysis, in response, can help scholars understand this field and identify points of interest. Methods: Publications related to mindfulness intervention in diabetes from the establishment of the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) to September 2023 were searched. We employed four bibliometric techniques: General Analysis of Publications, Collaborative Network Analysis, Co-citation Analysis, and Keyword Analysis. The CiteSpace 6.1.R was used to analyze the literature with the strongest citation bursts, while VOSviewer 1.6.13 was used to provide visualizations of publicly available data by analyzing co-citations or co-authorship affiliations. Results: We found a total of 387 articles. The results indicate that research on this topic has been steadily increasing over time. The United States is the top producer of relevant publications, with Tilburg University being the institution that publishes the most articles. The journal “Mindfulness” has the highest publication count. In the collaborative network analysis, the United States emerged as the main hub for global cooperation in this research field, contributing 182 articles with a total of 5872 citations. The journal “Diabetes Care” was frequently cited and played a central role. The keyword analysis revealed that researchers have shown a strong interest in how mindfulness interventions affect the mental health of diabetic individuals. Additionally, there is a focus on studying elderly diabetic groups and exploring how mindfulness interventions impact metabolic diseases. These areas are currently the main research priorities. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the current trend and hotspots in mindfulness intervention and offer some directions for future research. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Today, assumptions about probable future developments (at least as far as they make use of quantifiable scientific methods and are not pure speculation) are generally based on data from the past. An interesting way to analyze the future through this type of data is text mining or individual methods out of the spectrum of text mining, such as topic modeling. Topic Modeling itself is a combination of quantitative and qualitative methodology and is based on the full spectrum of social science methodology. Therefore, the method is an interesting way for futures research to analyze futures. This publication addresses the question of how a combination of different methods can contribute to trend monitoring or trend mining. For this purpose, a set of scientific publications was first generated with the help of a search query in the Web of Science (WoS), which is the basis for all evaluations and statements and topics. In essence, the method considered here should be more fully integrated into the scientific practice of futures research because it can make a valuable contribution to estimating future development based on past development. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Translational regulation plays the most critical role in gene expression. Ribosome profiling sequencing (Ribo-Seq) is one of the methods to study translation and its regulation. It is a high throughput technology based on deep sequencing, which targets ribosome protected mRNA fragments to produce a ‘global snapshot’ of translatome. There has been an annual increase in the number of publications incorporating Ribo-seq technology. Because of its importance, we used PubMed database to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis on Ribo-seq. We identified 2744 published articles that utilized the term ‘Ribo-seq’ between 2009 and Jan 2024, and 684 articles that contained both Ribo-seq and RNA-seq terms. Based on keywords correlation analysis, we discovered that the primary focus of Ribo-seq articles lies in the areas of translation, transcriptome, and ribosome in the past few years and other topics such as single-cell ribo-seq and crispr within two years, reflecting current areas of interests in Ribo-seq research. The Ribo-seq data analysis applications were also explored and summarized, providing a guide for researchers to choose corresponding tools for different types of analysis. Overall, we highlighted the advances made by Ribo-seq technologies, and the possibilities of utilizing machine learning models to unravel information from multi-omics data. The integration of Ribo-seq with other omics data, such as RNA-seq, is essential to understand the gene expression in complex biological systems. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This study examines the supply chain management of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Africa, aiming to demonstrate the patterns of publication in this field. An extensive examination of bibliometric analysis has been conducted using 338 published works obtained from the Dimensions database over the last 20 years. The study was conducted based on publications, sources, authors, and institutions as the primary units of analysis. The study determined the leading journals, prolific authors, partnering countries, and organizations involved in research on supply chain management specifically focused on micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Africa. Furthermore, it has been uncovered that the investigation of supply chain management in MSMEs in Africa needs to be revised in comparison to that of larger organizations. Moreover, publications in the field are not only insufficiently accessible, but also authored by scholars who are not of African descent. Given the crucial role of MSMEs in the African economy, scholars in this field are encouraged to prioritize research on the supply chain management of MSMEs as a critical issue for the twenty-first century. Furthermore, researchers are recommended to do additional analyses utilizing alternative databases such as Web of Sciences and Scopus. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: Significant scientific research has been conducted concerning menopausal syndrome(MPS), yet few bibliometric analyses have been performed. Our aim was to recognise the 100 most highly cited published articles on MPS and to analytically evaluate their key features. Methods: To identify the 100 most frequently cited articles, a search was conducted on Web of Science using the term 'menopausal syndrome'. Articles that matched the predetermined criteria were scrutinised to obtain the following data: citation ranking, year of publication, publishing journal, journal impact factor, country of origin, academic institution, authors, study type, and keywords. Results: The publication period is from January 1, 2000, to August 31, 2022. The maximum number of citations was 406 and in 2012. The median citations per year was 39.70. Most of the articles focused on treatment and complications. These articles were published in 36 different journals, with the Journal of MENOPAUSE having published the greatest number (14%). Forty-eight articles (48%) were from the United States, with the University of Pittsburgh being the leading institute (9%). Joann E. Manson was the most frequent first author (n = 6). Observational studies were the most frequently conducted research type (n = 53), followed by experimental studies (n = 33). Keyword analysis identified classic research topics, including genitourinary syndrome of menopause, bone mineral density (BMD), and anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) loci. Conclusion: Using bibliometrics, we conducted an analysis to identify the inadequacies, traditional focal points, and potential prospects in the study of MPS across current scientific areas. Treatment and complications are at the core of MPS research, whereas prediction and biomarkers have less literature of high quality. There is a necessity for innovative analytical metrics to measure the real effect of these papers with a high level of citation on clinical application. © The Author(s) 2024. corrected publication 2024.

AB  - Background: Acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) injury is a common orthopaedic condition accounting for over 40 % of all shoulder injuries. The purpose of this study is to assess the research trends and characteristics of the top 50 cited articles on ACJ instability. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in Web of Science to identify articles primarily related to ACJ injury or instability. Characteristics including citation number, country of origin, journal and institution of publication, impact factor, authorship, level of evidence, patient demographics, and study type were analyzed and recorded. Results: Research output on ACJ instability has been steadily increasing, with the top 50 cited studies predominantly presenting Level IV evidence. These studies primarily focused on treatment outcomes which included predominantly male patients and exhibited a large variation in citation counts. The American Journal of Sports Medicine was the most productive journal, and the USA was the most productive nation. Conclusion: There is an increasing number of publications in the ACJ instability literature, primarily concentrated in a few institutions and journals, and focusing mainly on treatment outcomes. A significant portion of these publications are of low scientific quality, and there is a notable lack of research on outcomes for females. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This review aims to explore the growing impact of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in the medical field, with a specific focus on the critical issues of explainability and interpretability associated with black-box algorithms. While machine learning algorithms are increasingly employed for medical analysis and diagnosis, their complexity underscores the importance of understanding how these algorithms explain and interpret data to take informed decisions. This review comprehensively analyzes challenges and solutions presented in the literature, offering an overview of the most recent techniques utilized in this field. It also provides precise definitions of interpretability and explainability, aiming to clarify the distinctions between these concepts and their implications for the decision-making process. Our analysis, based on 448 articles and addressing seven research questions, reveals an exponential growth in this field over the last decade. The psychological dimensions of public perception underscore the necessity for effective communication regarding the capabilities and limitations of artificial intelligence. Researchers are actively developing techniques to enhance interpretability, employing visualization methods and reducing model complexity. However, the persistent challenge lies in finding the delicate balance between achieving high performance and maintaining interpretability. Acknowledging the growing significance of artificial intelligence in aiding medical diagnosis and therapy, and the creation of interpretable artificial intelligence models is considered essential. In this dynamic context, an unwavering commitment to transparency, ethical considerations, and interdisciplinary collaboration is imperative to ensure the responsible use of artificial intelligence. This collective commitment is vital for establishing enduring trust between clinicians and patients, addressing emerging challenges, and facilitating the informed adoption of these advanced technologies in medicine. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - In the last decade, biochar application research has emerged as a hot topic in water treatment studies, which made biochar adsorption one of the primary wastewater treatment strategies. This paper presents a global bibliometric analysis of 2673 publications from the Web of Science database, spanning 2011–2022. For a comprehensive understanding of the research status and trends in biochar adsorption for wastewater treatment, the advanced quantitative and visual analysis tools (i.e., CiteSpace and ArcGIS) were employed. The results showed that China emerged as the leading country with the most published articles. The key research area is on the magnetic adsorption of biochar in wastewater. The articles summarized in the review demonstrated unequivocally that biochar can treat a wide range of wastewater even though the adsorption mechanisms of biochar on heavy metals, inorganic salts and organic pollutants in wastewater are not entirely consistent. The review further analyzes the factors affecting the performance of biochar in adsorbing pollutants from wastewater and the improvement measures of biochar functional characteristics, proposing the future research directions focusing on the improvement of the adsorption capacity of biochar products. The information synthesis and discussion would provide valuable insights on the historical, current, and future trends in biochar research, beneficial to solve the practical problems of water pollution and improve the quality of the environment. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: Delirium leads to prolongation in intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay and an increase in ICU costs and mortality. As a result of this, the number of studies on delirium in ICUs has recently increased significantly, and many articles have been published. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the articles related to “delirium” in “critical care” field in the Web of Science database and the first hundred most cited articles on this subject. Methods: The Web of Science database was searched for articles relevant to “delirium” in the critical care medicine field published between 1980 and 2024. Text analytics and network models used in bibliometric mapping were used for prolific authors, annual trend, citation, and countries. Results: In our study, it was determined that a total of 1834 articles in the field of delirium in critical care medicine were included. It was determined that the annual citation average was 42.79 and the H-index value was 134. There is a general upward trend over the years, and it was observed that it has intensified in the last 5 to 6years. With the Reference Spectroscopy analysis, it was determined that the most intensively cited studies on delirium were the studies of 2013 and 2010. The distribution of keywords in recent years has focused on analgosedation, acute brain injury, older patient, COVID-19, and fragility. When examined for the top 100 cited articles, it was seen that mobilization, guidelines, pain, activities of daily living, anesthesia, sedation, and haloperidol have become prominent in recent years. Conclusion: In recent years, there has been a noticeable increase in the volume of research focusing on delirium studies within the field of critical care medicine. Staying current with trends, incorporating findings from frequently cited studies, and customizing interventions to suit modern difficulties can all improve the quality of care offered to critically ill patients and lead to better outcomes.

AB  - This research aimed to provide a comprehensive mapping of studies on the application of the Hotelling rule in non-renewable resources from 1970 to 2024, identifying the most prominent research topics and trends, key characteristics, evolution, and directions for future studies. To achieve this, the following research questions were addressed using a mixed-method approach, including bibliometric analysis, text mining, and content analysis: (i) How has research on the Hotelling rule in non-renewable resources evolved? (ii) What are the most relevant research topics and trends in Hotelling rule research? and (iii) What future directions should studies on the Hotelling rule in non-renewable resources pursue? A total of 197 journal articles extracted from the Scopus database were analyzed to map the main body of literature. Four main research clusters were identified: (1) theoretical and empirical perspectives on the Hotelling rule, (2) the Hotelling rule in non-renewable resource management, (3) economic policy and sustainability within the Hotelling framework, and (4) resource depletion and pricing under the Hotelling rule. Four key areas for future research were proposed, focusing on diversification to other non-renewable resources, evaluation of policies and geographical contexts, technological innovations and government policies, and sector-specific applications of the Hotelling rule. These directions are crucial for promoting sustainability in the management of non-renewable resources over time. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater pose significant threats to both human health and aquatic ecosystems. Wastewater discharge from various sources is the primary cause of these contaminants, and proper treatment is essential for protecting the environment. Traditional treatment technologies are often too expensive and ineffective in removing PPCPs. Constructed wetlands (CWs) offer a sustainable, cost-efficient alternative for wastewater treatment, though their capability to eliminate PPCPs can vary based on multiple aspects. Recent studies highlight biochar—a carbon-rich material resultant from biomass pyrolysis—as a promising amendment to improve CW performance. However, there is a deficiency of proper literature reviews on using biochar in CWs specifically for PPCP removal. This review focuses on biochar's role in CWs and its effectiveness in removing PPCPs and enhancing microbial activity and nutrient cycling. A bibliometric analysis using Vosviewer software was used to assess the current research trends in the biochar-amended CWs to attenuate PPCPs. While biochar shows potential in eliminating PPCPs, challenges, such as optimizing its application and addressing long-term operational concerns for treating emerging pollutants like PPCPs. Future research should enhance biochar production and low-cost techniques for diverse groups of PPCPs and perform field trials to validate laboratory results under actual conditions exploring microbial–biochar and plant-biochar interactions. Addressing these challenges is crucial to advancing biochar-amended CWs and enhancing wastewater treatment on a global scale. © 2024 The Author

AB  - Shallow bathymetric mapping is important for navigation safety and geomorphologic, hydrologic and oceanographic research. However, field measurements and shipborne sonar are inefficient and dangerous to operate in shallow-water areas. In recent years, owing to its high efficiency, non-contact, and repeated observation benefits, remotely sensed bathymetry has grown quickly and is now being explored in depth. Spectral, photo, laser, and wave-derived bathymetry are among the common methods, which use platforms such as satellites, aircraft, and drones, and sensors such as optical cameras, lasers, and radars. These techniques provide bathymetry for shallow seas, rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. However, existing reviews are either outdated or cover just one aspect of bathymetry; a systematic review is needed. In this study, a bibliometric analysis of peer-reviewed research papers retrieved from the Scopus database was conducted. Based on this analysis, we further summarize the current methods, platforms, sensors, and applications in remote sensing bathymetry, and present our perspectives. Our results indicate that satellite-derived bathymetry is the current focus of this subject, while emerging drones generate higher-resolution bathymetric data. In addition, spectrally derived bathymetry is widely implemented in shallow waters, and laser bathymetry is highly accurate, while wave-derived bathymetry is an effective supplement for existing optical methods in coastal waters. Meanwhile, water penetrating radar, tethered sonar, and satellite altimetry are widely used for inland water bathymetry. However, single bathymetric approaches have their own limitations and typical physical/empirical models are often unable to accurately retrieve water depths in complicated situations. Therefore, remote sensing-based shallow-water bathymetry is moving towards data-driven modeling and multi-source coupling. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Governments in many countries actively carry out various policies to tackle pollution problems sourced from operations and supply chain activities, aiming at reducing adverse environmental impact and promoting sustainable development. This study provides a comprehensive and well-structured review of research on operations and supply chain management within the context of environmental policy. Specifically, this study meticulously identifies 137 papers and presents the descriptive results of a bibliometric analysis on these papers. Afterwards, using a well-defined framework encompassing three types of policies and various levels of operational and supply chain management, the identified papers are further classified. For each classification, content analyses are conducted accordingly, delving into the diverse concerns and contributions of the reviewed papers from the perspectives of pricing, production planning, inventory and technology management, coordination and competition, recycling and remanufacturing activities, transportation decisions, and network design. Three aspects of sustainability performance are also considered in the analyses. Finally, this study provides future research directions from seven perspectives: research methodology, forms of regulation, dynamic games, types of contracts, sustainable target management, green behavior of supply chain members, and investment constraints. These insights in turn inform the development of policies and decision-making processes related to environmental sustainability. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to employ bibliometric analysis to visualize hot spots and evolving trends in the studies on the relationship between vitamin D and obesity. Methods: From the Web of Science Core Collection database, articles on vitamin D and obesity from 2001 to 2021 were retrieved. For the bibliometric visualization analysis, CiteSpace was employed. Some of the figures were created using GraphPad software. Results: 4454 pieces of articles and reviews were found, with an average citation of 30.68 times. There are many more published papers in the area of “nutrition dietetics” (1166, 26.179 %). The United States possesses the largest number of publications (1297, 29.12 %) and demonstrates definitive leadership in this field. The League of European Research Universities generates a higher percentage of publications (256, 5.748 %) than other institutions. Major studies are funded by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (531, 11.922 %) and the National Institutes of Health, USA (528, 11.855 %). The top five keywords with the highest co-occurrence frequency are “obesity” (1260), “vitamin d” (943), “insulin resistance” (651), “risk” (642), and “d deficiency” (636). The biggest keyword cluster was #0 “adolescent” among the 18 keyword clusters. The three latest keywords in the keyword burst were "mineral density"、"d insufficiency" and "25 hydroxyvitamin d concentration". Conclusion: This bibliometric analysis shows an overview of the current status of the research on the association between vitamin D and obesity. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and the relationship between vitamin D and metabolic syndrome in obese individuals remains hot topics. We speculate that the effect of obesity on vitamin D levels and bone mineral density, and the influence of vitamin D insufficiency on various body systems in obese populations will be future trends. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Amidst the global digital transformation of educational institutions, digital technology has emerged as a significant area of interest among scholars. Such technologies have played an instrumental role in enhancing learner performance and improving the effectiveness of teaching and learning. These digital technologies also ensure the sustainability and stability of education during the epidemic. Despite this, a dearth of systematic reviews exists regarding the current state of digital technology application in education. To address this gap, this study utilized the Web of Science Core Collection as a data source (specifically selecting the high-quality SSCI and SCIE) and implemented a topic search by setting keywords, yielding 1849 initial publications. Furthermore, following the PRISMA guidelines, we refined the selection to 588 high-quality articles. Using software tools such as CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Charticulator, we reviewed these 588 publications to identify core authors (such as Selwyn, Henderson, Edwards), highly productive countries/regions (England, Australia, USA), key institutions (Monash University, Australian Catholic University), and crucial journals in the field (Education and Information Technologies, Computers & Education, British Journal of Educational Technology). Evolutionary analysis reveals four developmental periods in the research field of digital technology education application: the embryonic period, the preliminary development period, the key exploration, and the acceleration period of change. The study highlights the dual influence of technological factors and historical context on the research topic. Technology is a key factor in enabling education to transform and upgrade, and the context of the times is an important driving force in promoting the adoption of new technologies in the education system and the transformation and upgrading of education. Additionally, the study identifies three frontier hotspots in the field: physical education, digital transformation, and professional development under the promotion of digital technology. This study presents a clear framework for digital technology application in education, which can serve as a valuable reference for researchers and educational practitioners concerned with digital technology education application in theory and practice. © The Author(s) 2024.

Methods: This study employed the Web of Science Core Collection, BIOSIS Citation Index, and Derwent Innovations Index for conducting keyword searches on ’big data’ and ’medical devices’, focusing on English-language articles, reviews, and patents, while excluding duplicates. Quantitative analyses and visualizations were facilitated using tools such as R 4.3.1, VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and Tableau. The research assessed the impact of journals and academic contributions through metrics like the impact factor and G-Index. Results: Our analysis covered 592 articles and 795 patents. Notably, the annual growth rate of articles reached 62.19%, with the primary contributions originating from China, the United States, India, and England. Among the identified publications, “IEEE Access” emerged as the most prominent journal. The research identified key trends in the application of big data within medical devices, including the extensive use of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, genomic data analysis, and bioinformatics. Case studies show how big data and medical device integration, exemplified by Electronic Health Records (EHRs), Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), and smart wearables, enhance diagnostic efficiency and care quality. The study further identified intensive care units, radiology departments, and oncology as key application departments leveraging this integration. Conclusion: Big data and medical device integration have led to smart healthcare and personalized treatment, improving medical decision accuracy and inspiring new research directions. Future research efforts should explore the potential for incorporating even more expansive datasets and multilingual resources to further maximize the potential of this integration and advance medical technology in disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Cyberpreneurship, as a subset of entrepreneurship, is an emerging field focusing on the use of digital platforms and technologies in business. This study aims to analyze the development and trends in cyberpreneurship research over the past 17 years (1999-2023). The objective is to map the landscape of cyberpreneurship publications, identifying key countries, institutions, journals, authors, and keywords that dominate the field. Using the Dimensions citation indexing database, a bibliometric analysis was conducted, employing VOSviewer for visualizing the relationships among authors, institutions, and keywords. Data was examined based on publication pairs, co-authorship networks, and keyword co-occurrence. The analysis shows that Malaysia leads in cyberpreneurship research, with Multimedia University as the most influential institution, and Education and Training as the most cited journal. The research also highlights a significant growth in cyberpreneurship studies, especially in the last few years, indicating its increasing importance post-COVID-19. The findings suggest that cyberpreneurship is still in its early stages, with substantial potential for future research, particularly in the application of artificial intelligence and digital business models. Further exploration is recommended, especially in countries like Indonesia, where digital entrepreneurship is rapidly evolving. © Authors retain all copyrights.

AB  - Background: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation has become an active research area in viral infection, while little bibliometric analysis has been performed. In this study, we aim to visualize hotspots and trends using bibliometric analysis to provide a comprehensive and objective overview of the current research dynamics in this field. Methods: The data related to m6A methylation in viral infection were obtained through the Web of Science Core Collection form 2000 to 2022. To reduce bias, the literature search was conducted on December 1, 2022. Bibliometric and visual analyzes were performed using CiteSpace and Bibliometrix package. After screening, 319 qualified records were retrieved. Results: These publications mainly came from 28 countries led by China and the United States (the US), with the US ranking highest in terms of total link strength.The most common keywords were m6A, COVID-19, epitranscriptomics, METTL3, hepatitis B virus, innate immunity and human immunodeficiency virus 1. The thematic map showed that METTL3, plant viruses, cancer progression and type I interferon (IFN-I) reflected a good development trend and might become a research hotspot in the future, while post-transcriptional modification, as an emerging or declining theme, might not develop well. Conclusions: In conclusion, m6A methylation in viral infection is an increasingly important topic in articles. METTL3, plant viruses, cancer progression and IFN-I may still be research hotspots and trends in the future. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - The catastrophic impacts of climate change and the ever-increasing energy demand have spurred the rapid development of microgrids in recent decades. This paper addresses the evolving field of microgrid systems, focusing on performance evaluation, which is a subject of great academic interest. To augment existing knowledge, our study presents an overview and a thorough analysis of microgrid performance evaluation. The evaluation encompasses two primary themes: bibliometric analysis and thematic quantification. Utilizing a targeted search of the Scopus database in January 2024, we identified relevant articles between 2015 and 2024, resulting in 3932 relevant publications. A subsequent screening process narrowed the selection to the top 200 papers based on citations, and a detailed full-text analysis further refined our sample to 189 articles. Bibliometric research reveals patterns in the dynamics of publications, productive authors, active journals, geographical distribution and collaboration, and key subject categories. Additionally, we present a network analysis of co-authorship patterns among countries, frequently used keywords, and the most cited articles. We also examined the policy citations of the selected articles. Thematic quantification of selected papers systematically categorizes content into various themes, comprising frequently employed sources/renewable energy resources, control techniques, common bus and load types, types of studies and themes, and microgrid locations. Our findings offer valuable insights into the current landscape of this continually evolving field, shedding light on trends and providing recommendations for future research directions. © 2024

AB  - In this section of Human Arenas, we continue the critical and constructive analysis of the contemporary state of affairs of universities as arenas for both the highest level of education and for the creation of new knowledge that was started 5 years ago (Valsiner et al. in Sustainable futures for higher education: The making of knowledge makers (pp. vii-x) Cham, 2018a) and continued recently (Gebert & Woller in Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science 56, 4, 2023). Admittedly, the Humboldtian ideal of freedom for knowledge creation united with education has eroded in the social-administrative assumption of control over universities. As a result, today we can observe institutions of higher education gloriously producing graduates with various certificates as a reward for successfully passing through the socially approved curricula under the general pressures of neoliberal ideologies that emphasize social and fiscal conformity to expectations. The result in the side of contents of the education is intensive replication of existing knowledge with limited emphasis on innovations that go beyond the approved curriculae. This is successfully camouflaged by introducing different criteria of success of the institutions—value ranking of universities, bibliometric indices in scholarly evaluations, creating mandatory courses, and expecting academics to bring in funds into the universities under the conditions of the high rate of rejections of grant applications. The contributions to this section bring forth concrete suggestions for new ways of restoration of knowledge construction focus to university frameworks: new forms of courses with non-fixed learning tasks, close unity of internship experiences with post-graduation activities, and substitution of mandatory elements of higher education by necessary ones with openness to future construction of knowledge. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

AB  - This research paper presents a comprehensive scientometric analysis of English articles from the Scopus database regarding the topic of cover crop management from 1956 to March 2024. Through the analysis of the annual production trend, total production, a co-occurrence network of keywords, co-authorship networks, and co-citation networks, the data was mapped and visualized using VOSviewer and Bibliometrix software. There was an exponential increase in publications from 1991 onwards. The predominant subject was Agricultural and Biological Sciences and the most relevant journals, authors, and documents were related to this topic. Additionally, the most productive country was the United States, but in terms of article production per surface area, other countries, such as Switzerland and The Netherlands, evidence the great weight of cover crop management in these countries. The identified research topics were related to the application of different crops as cover crops and the effects on different cultivars, also soil quality improvement, and fertilization and nutrient efficiency. An emerging research topic was found to be the usefulness of cover crops as effective tools for climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in agriculture. Future research in the field of cover crop management could be directed towards climate-adaptive cover crop species and varieties, the use of technological innovations for cover crop monitoring, and management and analysis of the economic and social impacts of cover crop adoption. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Interactions between groundwater and surface water sustain groundwater-dependent ecosystems and regulate river temperature and biogeochemical cycles, amongst many other processes. These interactions occur in freshwater environments including rivers, springs, lakes, and wetlands, and in coastal environments via tidal pumping, submarine groundwater discharge, and seawater intrusion. Here, we explore groundwater-surface water interactions research using bibliometric analyses of titles, abstracts, and keywords from 20,275 journal papers published between 1970 and 2023 extracted from Scopus. Analyses show that research into groundwater-surface water interactions is highly multi-disciplinary, with growing contributions from the social and biological sciences. The number of groundwater-surface water interactions papers is rapidly increasing with over 1200 papers published per year since 2020. Drawing on our data-driven approach and expert knowledge, we synthesise current research trends and identify critical future research directions. Despite the thousands of papers on groundwater-surface water interactions, important processes are still difficult to quantify or predict at meaningful spatial scales to inform water-resources management. We see benefits in future groundwater-surface water interactions research focusing on: (1) using new technologies including internet-of-things-based sensors, uncrewed vehicles, and remote-sensing approaches for data collection to inform groundwater-surface water interactions at large scales, (2) seeking approaches to upscale site-specific findings to better inform management, and (3) continuing the movement towards multi-disciplinary investigations to better inform the understanding of groundwater-surface water interactions and processes that will enable better management outcomes. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anesthesiology departments and professional organizations increasingly recognize the need to embrace diverse membership to effectively care for patients, to educate our trainees, and to contribute to innovative research.1 Bibliometric analysis uses citation data to determine the patterns of interrelatedness within a scientific community. Social network analysis examines these patterns to elucidate the network's functional properties. Using these methodologies, an analysis of contemporary scholarly work was undertaken to outline network structure and function, with particular focus on the equity of node and graph-level connectivity patterns. METHODS: Using the Web of Science, this study examines bibliographic data from 6 anesthesiology-specific journals between January 1, 2017, and August 26, 2022. The final data represent 4453 articles, 19,916 independent authors, and 4436 institutions. Analysis of coauthorship was performed using R libraries software. Collaboration patterns were assessed at the node and graph level to analyze patterns of coauthorship. Influential authors and institutions were identified using centrality metrics; author influence was also cataloged by the number of publications and highly cited papers. Independent assessors reviewed influential author photographs to classify race and gender. The Gini coefficient was applied to examine dispersion of influence across nodes. Pearson correlations were used to investigate the relationship between centrality metrics, number of publications, and National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding. RESULTS: The modularity of the author network is significantly higher than would be predicted by chance (0.886 vs random network mean 0.340, P <.01), signifying strong community formation. The Gini coefficient indicates inequity across both author and institution centrality metrics, representing moderate to high disparity in node influence. Identifying the top 30 authors by centrality metrics, number of published and highly cited papers, 79.0% were categorized as male; 68.1% of authors were classified as White (non-Latino) and 24.6% Asian. CONCLUSIONS: The highly modular network structure indicates dense author communities. Extracommunity cooperation is limited, previously demonstrated to negatively impact novel scientific work.2,3 Inequitable node influence is seen at both author and institution level, notably an imbalance of information transfer and disparity in connectivity patterns. There is an association between network influence, article publication (authors), and NIH funding (institutions). Female and minority authors are inequitably represented among the most influential authors. This baseline bibliometric analysis provides an opportunity to direct future network connections to more inclusively share information and integrate diverse perspectives, properties associated with increased academic productivity.3,4. © 2024 International Anesthesia Research Society.

AB  - This bibliometric study analyzes 1433 former reviews on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Sustainability, providing a comprehensive overview of the evolving research landscape in this domain. Notably, we observe a substantial annual growth rate of 74% in publications and a remarkable 171% increase in total citations from 2016 to 2022, reflecting a growing interest in this area. We identify the leading countries and institutions contributing to quantitative reviews on SDGs and Sustainability. SDG 12 (Sustainable Consumption and Production) emerges as the most extensively studied and is highly represented in influential journals like Sustainability and the Journal of Cleaner Production. Across various research fields, SDGs 12 and 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) stand out, with SDGs 4 (Quality Education), 5 (Gender Equality), and 15 (Life on Land) showing significance in specific domains. Thematic analysis reveals key topics like environmental protection, circular economy, life cycle assessment, and supply chain management, with strong connections to SDG 12. Further clusters highlight environmental management, renewable energy, and energy policy linked to SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), along with a smaller cluster focusing on urbanization driven by SDG 11. Network analysis emphasizes the critical roles of SDGs 12 and 9 (Industry Innovation and Infrastructure) in achieving a sustainable future. However, alternative social network indicators highlight the potential influence of SDGs 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) on other goals. Intriguingly, mainstream SDG research predominantly focuses on SDGs 3 and 7, presenting challenges due to the volume and complexity of related publications. While SDG 7 could find suitable outlets in leading journals, addressing SDG 3’s (Good Health and Well Being) complexity remains a formidable task. Nevertheless, conducting bibliometric studies on SDGs 3, 7, and 13 (Climate Action) offers promising opportunities in future if the associated challenges are addressed effectively. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - The correct application of by-products produced in the food and dairy industries is essential for attaining sustainability goals and minimising waste. By-products, which used to be viewed as throwaway materials, have lately been recognised as valuable sources. By-products can have significant nutritional, physiological and economic value. This paper addresses the novel techniques and technologies that have been employed to successfully transform these by-products into products with value-added hybrid products; there are also some instances of success mentioned, as well as the trends that will likely have an impact on the sector in the coming years. Through case studies and scientific insights, the reader may discover how businesses and society as a whole can benefit from using by-products. Overall, the goal of this endeavour is to demonstrate the transformative potential of using food and dairy by-products and to serve as an avenue of encouragement and knowledge for researchers, business executives and policymakers interested in increasing the value of by-products in the food and dairy sectors. Despite the fact that there are a few articles on the utilisation of food and dairy by-products, none of them have employed bibliometric analysis to reach insights. The present study is an exemplary instance of looking into the evolution of publication patterns over time, suggesting the need for additional research in this area. © 2024 Institute of Food Science & Technology (IFST).

AB  - Affirmative action (AA) has long been viewed negatively in contemporary society. The political philosophies of AA are still widely misunderstood and fiercely debated around the world today. The argument against AA is that faculty hired through AA are less efficient than those hired through open/general category. This research attempts to empirically assess if professors from the Other Backward Class (OBC), Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) categories in India’s three Central Universities are equally productive and effective as their General category counterparts. The effectiveness of the four teaching categories (General/OBC/SC/ST) was evaluated using the CCR model of Data Envelopment Analysis, while the productivity of teachers was estimated using bibliometric analysis. The data analysis demonstrates that AA positively impacts the research productivity of marginalized groups, except ST, which has very low representation in Pure and Applied Sciences, with OBC and SC performing on par with their General counterpart when placed in higher productivity subjects. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - We argue for the application of bibliometric indices to quantify the long-term uncertainty of outcome in sports. The Euclidean index is proposed to reward quality over quantity, while the rectangle index can be an appropriate measure of core performance. Their differences are highlighted through an axiomatic analysis and several examples. Our approach also requires a weighting scheme to compare different achievements. The methodology is illustrated by studying the knockout stage of the UEFA Champions League in the 20 seasons played between 2003 and 2023: club and country performances as well as three types of competitive balance are considered. Measuring competition at the level of national associations is a novelty. All results are remarkably robust concerning the bibliometric index and the assigned weights. Since the performances of national associations are more stable than the results of individual clubs, it would be better to build the seeding in the UEFA Champions League group stage upon association coefficients adjusted for league finishing positions rather than club coefficients. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The Indian oil sardine (Sardinella longiceps, hereafter IOS) has a unique position in terms of its economic value. In the last decade, IOS has contributed about 15–20% to India's total marine fish landings. However, recently, a sharp decline has been observed in the annual landing of the resource, and it is on the verge of collapsing due to climatic and anthropogenic perturbations. Various researchers have observed a cyclic pattern of wide annual fluctuation for IOS. This review revealed a long history of IOS research dating back to 1924. To mine the information regarding past research on IOS, bibliometric analysis has been carried out to understand the growth of literature, research area focuses, and research requirements. This study highlights a noticeable shift in research focus regarding IOS. While earlier investigations centered primarily on the physiology and biochemical properties of sardine and sardine oil, contemporary research emphasizes oceanographic parameters in relation to the IOS life cycle. The evolution of research efforts now extends beyond taxonomic classification, encompassing ecological, fisheries, and environmental aspects. The study underscores an increasing awareness of the multifaceted challenges posed by climate change and anthropogenic activities, which have prompted a transition toward interdisciplinary research approaches aimed at IOS conservation. A notable gap identified in this study is the lack of comprehensive analyses on IOS habitat suitability, particularly under dynamic oceanographic conditions and environmental indicators critical for predicting IOS availability. Additionally, the study points to the potential application of advanced predictive modeling techniques, including regression-based models such as Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Generalized Additive Models (GAM), as well as machine learning approaches like Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) and Random Forest (RF), to predict IOS abundance and distribution effectively. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Captagon is a synthetic stimulant combining amphetamine and theophylline. Initially introduced in 1961 as a treatment for hyperactivity, depression, and narcolepsy, Captagon was later classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance due to its addictive and hallucinogenic properties. Despite its global prohibition in 1986, the trade of counterfeit products is widespread, especially in south-east Europe and far-east Asia, with its production being on the rise in Middle Eastern regions. This paper presents a quantitative data-driven bibliometric analysis of the existing literature on Captagon up to July 2024. It aims to delineate the structure and development of knowledge surrounding the substance, including key contributing countries, authors, prominent sources, and recurring thematic keywords. The quantitative and data-driven results were then used to guide the narrative discussion on Captagon. Findings indicate that current research predominantly focuses on Captagon's use and impact in conflict zones, often exploring its interaction with other substances used by civilians and militias. Results also show a growing trend in Captagon research, with Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Iraq emerging as main contributors to the literature. Despite the attention in specific regions, a considerable gap remains in understanding the mechanisms of action of Captagon (particularly regarding its metabolism, toxicology, mortality risk), and in developing protocols for its discontinuation. Additionally, the drug's inconsistent composition requires further analyses to better predict risks and establish effective management strategies. Addressing these gaps will be crucial for the development of novel interventions and policies to mitigate the adverse effects of Captagon and improve public health systems worldwide. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - This study aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the research trend in transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) inhibition and modulation. A bibliometric analysis of peer-reviewed articles and reviews published from 2003 until 2022 in the Scopus database was conducted. A total of 7,470 publications were retrieved and distributed over 140 countries and published by 23,875 authors. The number of publications was increasing over the determined period, indicating a steady upward trend. Approximately 80% of the total extracted publications were research articles. The leading country in this research field is the United States of America. The top publishing journal was the British Journal of Pharmacology. The most frequent keywords included TRPV1, pain, and capsaicin. Analysis of authors-keywords pointed to the role of TRPV1 inhibition in numerous conditions including cancer, inflammation, oxidative stress, pruritus, osteoarthritis, migraine, the endocannabinoid system, nitric oxide, and endothelium relaxation. This study revealed most of the research was focused on the role of TRPV1 channels in pain. However, TRPV1 has been implicated in different pathological conditions. This implication should be translated into the development of therapeutic strategy, and efforts should be expanded into new clinical indications and novel drug discovery. © 2024 Shereen M.

Due to the unprecedented digital transitions that businesses are seeing, AI integration in Human resource management (HRM) has become a significant area of focus. This systematic literature critically examines how AI is altering the landscape of its impact on employee performance in the HRM area in the era of digital transformation. The Scopus database, where 73 peer-reviewed articles are found These are subjected to integrated methodology of Bibliometric analysis, Content analysis, Epistemological analysis and Substantive analysis to identify the emerging themes, trends and contribution of theory in the AI impact on the employee performance in digital transformation era. The results identifies the major themes a) Digital Transformation in HRM for enhancing Efficiency b) Deep learning and neural networks in HRM c) Innovation and Technology adoption in HRM and d) Human resource investments. From the epistemological analysis results “Resource Based theory,” has been mentioned highest (4 times) and shows how HRM is evolving in the context of digital change. With 3 instances each, institutional theory with empirical study is being the most common method. Substantive analysis shows the Digital Transformation, Employee Performance, Work life balance, and Organisational change are the significant criteria, whereas sub-criteria included Innovation, performance management, and Techno stress. Additionally, it investigates the challenges and opportunities arising from how AI is incorporated into HRM procedures and its implications for workforce dynamics. The study has proposed a model of 3 major criteria and 14 sub criteria for future research actions based on substantive analysis. AI integration in HRM requires strategic planning, ethical considerations, and employee well-being. Organisations that recognise these consequences and handle issues will be more prepared for AI-driven HRM. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The use of enzymes or microorganisms for the synthesis of aroma compounds is a valuable strategy to meet the growing consumers’ demand for natural products. Short-to-medium chain esters are widely used in the industry to provide fruity and floral flavors and fragrances to foods, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. We present an extensive bibliometric analysis of the literature between 2000 and 2023 dealing with the biotechnological synthesis of aroma esters based on the review of 644 scientific documents retrieved from the Scopus database. The VOSviewer software was applied to analyze the bibliometric indicators of quantity and quality. The results showed the strategic distribution map of the different journals and countries where research groups developed this topic. It became evident that the research focused mainly on isoamyl acetate, 2-phenylethyl acetate and other acetate esters. We review recent progress regarding native microorganisms and recombinant enzymes that produce esters by esterification, Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, alcohol acylation and hemiacetal dehydrogenation. As a concluding remark, it is worth mentioning that lipases are the most frequently reported biocatalysts for the synthesis of aroma esters but the use of other enzymes has grown significantly in the last years, especially as part of cascades or modified metabolic pathways. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sustainable development goals and rising sustainability concerns push stakeholders and society to demand organizations adopt innovative practices that can contribute to business sustainability. This study aims to provide a systematic review through comprehensive bibliometric analysis of almost 1st quarter of the 21st century. The main focus is on how green human resource management practices promote and have a relationship with environmental performance, which is a significant part of sustainability. The authors systematically reviewed 242 top-tier articles from Scopus and Web of Science databases by following the “preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses” methodology. A significant relationship began in 2015 and gained popularity after COVID-19. The studies suggest that management should embrace the most demanding green human resource management practices, such as green competence building, motivation enhancement, and employee involvement, for better environmental performance. So, organizations can help acquire and retain committed and eco-friendly employees whose ecological values and objectives are compatible with the organization. The study also provides insight into the role of green human resource management practices in fostering eco-friendly behaviour of employees that, in turn, influence environmental performance. Most authors used the theory of ability-motivation-opportunity, a supporting mechanism for how organizations protect the environment through adopting green human resource management practices. In the future, corporate environmental responsibility, environmental regulations intensity, pro-environmental behaviour, and green work-life balance are suggested mechanisms to enhance environmental performance through green human resource management practices. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objective: To identify the trends of the top 100 cited articles on economic evaluation in preventive oral health programs. Methods: Top 100 papers involving economic evaluation or cost analysis of preventive oral health programs were selected by querying Scopus and Web of Science databases. Bibliometric analysis was performed using the Bibliometrix tool in R Studio. Performance analysis and science mapping were performed for these 100 articles. Performance analysis included publication-related metrics, citation-related metrics, and citation-publication-related metrics. Science mapping provided information on citation analysis, co-citation analysis, bibliographic coupling, co-word analysis, and co-authorship details. Results: The total citation number of the top 100 most cited articles ranged from 4 to 98, with publication dates spanning from 1978 to 2023. The majority of articles (33.70 %) originated from the USA, while Community Dentistry and Oral Epidemiology stood out as the journal with the highest number of articles published in the top 100 (16 out of 100). Griffin PM emerged as the most cited author, based on the frequency measurement of the number of papers. Program data economic evaluation was the most commonly reported study design, and fluoridation programs were the most frequent topic. The most reported type of economic analysis performed in the articles was cost-effectiveness analysis. Conclusion: The bibliometric analysis of the top 100 most-cited articles on economic evaluation of preventive oral health programs revealed the lacunae in the research literature on this topic. Therefore, preventive oral health programs should be economically evaluated to eliminate the disparity in resource allocation particularly in upper middle income and low-income countries. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Background: Subglottic Stenosis (SGS), with increasing numbers of studies, is the most specific and common clinical type of Laryngotracheal Stenosis (LTS). There is rapid publication turnover with newer management introduced and expanding research field. To our knowledge, there is no bibliometric analysis of SGS yet. Methods: In August 2022, we performed a thorough search in the Web of Science Core Collection database using the word “subglottic stenosis,” and “SGS.” The 580 articles were arranged based on correlation. The collected articles were then analyzed with an assessment of relevant factors. Meanwhile, we analyzed the top 100 most-cited articles on SGS. Results: The frequency of publication on SGS has increased substantially over time. The USA has contributed the most articles (n = 301). Vanderbilt University published most of the articles among other institutions (n = 18). Laryngoscope topped the list of journals and has published 89 SGS-related articles. Research hotspots shift from surgical treatment to conservative management. Conclusions: The SGS-related literature has grown rapidly in recent years. This study represents the first bibliometric analysis of scientific articles on SGS. Areas to improve in SGS research can be identified after this analysis of the most impactful articles on this topic. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Although service quality in spectator sports has been subject to extensive research, comprehensive studies mapping the intellectual structure and foundations of service quality in spectator sports are scant. The purpose of the current study was to synthesise and analyse the literature on service quality in spectator sports, and set a new research agenda by conducting a hybrid integrated review of the articles between 1996 and 2023. A total of 149 peer-reviewed journal articles were analyzed. First, a bibliometric analysis provided the citation structure and evolution of publications, source impact, most cited articles, most productive authors and associated impact. Then, a framework-based review including the articles' context, theories, type of study, service quality dimensions, spectator outcomes and limitations was conducted to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge and identify future research directions. This study contributes to the literature by uncovering the structure and intellectual base of existent research, identifying gaps and suggesting a research agenda to deepen the understanding and management of service quality in spectator sports. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - The emergence of COVID-19 in 2019 has resulted in a significant global health crisis. Consequently, extensive research was published to understand and mitigate the disease. In particular, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been considered the benchmark for assessing the efficacy and safety of interventions. Hence, the present study strives to present a comprehensive overview of the global research landscape pertaining to RCTs and COVID-19. A bibliometric analysis was performed using the Scopus database. The search parameters included articles published from 2020 to 2022 using keywords specifically related to COVID-19 and RCTs. The data were analyzed using various bibliometric indicators. The volume of publications, contributions of countries and institutions, funding agencies, active journals, citation analysis, co-occurrence analysis, and future research direction analysis were specifically analyzed. A total of 223,480 research articles concerning COVID-19 were published, with 3,727 of them related to RCTs and COVID-19. The ten most productive countries collectively produced 75.8% of the documents, with the United States leading the way by contributing 31.77%, followed by the UK with 14.03% (n = 523), China with 12.96% (n = 483) and Canada with 7.16% (n = 267). Trials (n = 173, 4.64%), BMJ Open (n = 81, 2.17%), PLOS One (n = 73, 1.96%) and JAMA Network Open (n = 53, 1.42%) were the most active journals in publishing articles related to COVID-19 RCTs. The co-occurrence analysis identified four clusters of research areas: the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, mental health strategies to cope with the impact of the pandemic, the use of monoclonal antibodies to treat patients with COVID-19, and systematic reviews and meta-analyses of COVID-19 research. This paper offers a detailed examination of the global research environment pertaining to RCTs and their use in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The comprehensive body of research findings was found to have been generated by the collaborative efforts of multiple countries, institutions, and funding organizations. The predominant research areas encompassed COVID-19 vaccines, strategies for mental health, monoclonal antibodies, and systematic reviews. This information has the potential to aid researchers, policymakers, and funders in discerning areas of weakness and establishing areas of priority. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Acupressure has proven efficacy in symptoms management, making it valuable in clinical practice and patient care. Given the rising number of increasing publications on acupressure, we aimed to analyze the literature from the past 20 years and provided current trends and hotspot for future research directions. Methods: Publications on acupressure from January 1, 2004 through May 1, 2024 were retrieved from the Web of Science database. The extracted records underwent thorough analysis based on publication year, research area, journal, countries/regions, organization, authors, and keywords. The bibliometric analysis was conducted using Citespace and Microsoft Excel software. Results: Of the 1,929 screened records, 770 publications were identified. The annual number of acupressure has gradually increased, with the 45 % of the total publication occurring from 2020 to 2024. Among countries and institutions, China (252 articles) and Hong Kong Polytechnic University (41 articles) have the highest number of publications. Notably, USA and Hong Kong Polytechnic University exhibits the highest centrality score in cooperative network among countries/regions and institutions. Chao Hsing Yeh from the Cizik School of Nursing, University of Texas Health Science Center, was the most prolific author with 22 papers. Evidence-Based Comple Alt, with 53 articles, is the journal with the most publications. According to the keyword, timeline diagram and prominence mapping analysis, we believe that “insomnia”, “labor”, “waist circumference”, “reliability” and “vagus nerve stimulation” related clusters may be new hotspots in the field of acupressure. Conclusion: This study presents the research trajectory of acupressure over the past 20 years, providing a foundation for future research and highlighting the significant contributions of nursing researchers. By analyzing research trends and hotsport, nursing professionals can integrate acupressure more effectively into holistic patient care, improving quality of life, and contributing to traditional Chinese medicine. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - In the context of the fourth industrial revolution, this study examines the digital transformation of the luxury industry through a bibliometric analysis of 236 articles (1991–2022) and a bibliographic coupling of research from 2022 to 2024. The analysis identifies key trends, including the use of digital tools to enhance customer engagement, the growing role of review-based feedback in the tourism sector, value creation through innovative products and promotional strategies, and the advances in sustainability via digitalization. Despite these hot trends, many firms in the luxury sector have not yet involved in a real digital transformation, as they have only digitalized specific aspects of their operations. The findings suggest that while luxury firms are embracing digital tools to meet the expectations of digitally native consumers, they face the challenge of balancing innovation with the preservation of their core values. The study concludes that digital transformation is not merely an operational shift but a strategic imperative for the future competitiveness and profitability of the luxury sector. © 2024

AB  - In a Sustainable Supply Chain (SSC) context, information management offers a unique perspective on the digital economy and information management. Artificial intelligence (AI) is developing into a more robust digital field to facilitate quick information access and intelligent decisions in expanding commercial contexts. These days, Supply Chains (SC) would crumble without robust information systems. Applying AI and information management is crucial in determining the direction of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM). A systematic literature review (SLR) of the use of AI in SSCM is conducted in this research. The authors can identify crucial factors of the present literature using bibliometric and network analysis. AI is essential to the SSC to address sustainability challenges and manage the large volumes of data produced by numerous industrial processes. In the corpus of research that is already accessible, there is currently no comprehensive and bibliometric analysis of the potential for AI techniques for information management in SSC. Scientific publications were analysed from an objective point of view. Based on our results, we have drafted a proposal for an AI supply chain framework. Researchers, policymakers, and SCM practitioners may all benefit from the approach. This study is the first to analyse AI applications for information management in SSCM. In consideration of this, organizations are now exploring AI capabilities to improve operational efficiency and innovate their processes. This will assist industry people in understanding how AI methods support SC processes in their optimization to attain sustainability in SC practices. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: Research on penile cancer (PeCa) is predominantly conducted in countries with centralized treatment of PeCa-patients. In Germany and Austria (G + A), no state-regulated centralization is established, and no information is available on how PeCa-research is organized. Methods: Current research competence in PeCa was assessed by a 36-item questionnaire sent to all chairholders of urological academic centers in G + A. Based on PubMed records, all scientific PeCa-articles of 2012–2022 from G + A were identified. Current research trends were assessed by dividing the literature search into two periods (P1: 2012–2017, P2: 2018–2022). A bibliometric analysis was supplemented. Results: Response rate of the questionnaire was 75%, a median of 13 (IQR: 9–26) PeCa-patients/center was observed in 2021. Retrospective case series were conducted by 38.9% of participating clinics, while involvement in randomized-controlled trials was stated in 8.3% and in basic/fundamental research in 19.4%. 77.8% declared an interest in future multicenter projects. 205 PeCa-articles were identified [median impact factor: 2.77 (IQR: 0.90–4.37)]. Compared to P1, P2 showed a significant increase in the median annual publication count (29 (IQR: 13–17) vs. 15 (IQR: 19–29), p < 0.001), in multicenter studies (79.1% vs. 63.6%, p = 0.018), and in multinational studies (53% vs. 28.9%, p < 0.001); the proportion of basic/fundamental research articles significantly declined (16.5% vs. 28.9%, p = 0.041). Four of the top-5 institutions publishing PeCa-articles are academic centers. Bibliometric analyses revealed author networks, primary research areas in PeCa, and dominant journals for publications. Conclusions: Given the lack of centralization in G + A, this analysis highlights the need for research coordination within multicenter PeCa-projects. The decline in basic/fundamental research should be effectively addressed by the allocation of funded research projects. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Considering the widespread and indispensable nature of nuclear energy for future power generation, there is a concurrent increase in the discharge of radioactive Cs into water streams. Recent studies have demonstrated that adsorption is crucial in removing Cs from wastewater for environmental remediation. However, the existing literature lacks comprehensive studies on various adsorption methods, the capacities or efficiencies of adsorbents, influencing factors, isotherm and kinetic models of the Cs adsorption process. A bibliometric and comprehensive analysis was conducted using 1179 publications from the Web of Science Core Collection spanning from 2014 to 2023. It reviews and summarizes current publication trends, active countries, adsorption methods, adsorption capacities or efficiencies of adsorbents, tested water sources, influencing factors, isotherm, and kinetic models of Cs adsorption. The selection of suitable adsorbents and operating parameters is identified as a crucial factor. Over the past decade, due to their notable capacity for Cs adsorption, considerable research has focused on novel adsorbents, such as Prussian blue, graphene oxide, hydrogel, and nanoadsorbents (NA). However, there remains a need for further development of application-oriented laboratory-scale experiments. Future research directions should encompass exploring adsorption mechanisms, developing new adsorbents or their combinations, practical applications of lab-scale studies, and recycling radioactive Cs from wastewater. Drawing upon this literature review, we present the most recent research patterns concerning adsorbents to remove Cs, outline potential avenues for future research, and delineate the obstacles hindering effective adsorption. This comprehensive bibliometric review provides valuable insights into prevalent research focal points and emerging trends, serving as a helpful resource for researchers and policymakers seeking to understand the dynamics of adsorbents for Cs removal from water. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BACKGROUND With the increasing of the global aging population, healthy aging and prevention of age-related diseases have become increasingly important. The liver, a vital organ involved in metabolism, detoxification, digestion, and immunity, holds a pivotal role in the aging process of organisms. Although extensive research on liver aging has been carried out, no bibliometric analysis has been conducted to evaluate the scientific progress in this area. AIM To analyze basic knowledge, development trends, and current research frontiers in the field via bibliometric methods. METHODS We conducted bibliometric analyses via a range of analytical tools including Python, the bibliometrix package in R, CiteSpace, and VOSviewer. We retrieved publication data on liver aging research from the Web of Science Core Collection Database. A scientific knowledge map was constructed to display the contributions from different authors, journals, countries, institutions, as well as patterns of co-occurrence keywords and co-cited references. Additionally, gene regulation pathways associated with liver aging were analyzed via the STRING database. RESULTS We identified 4288 articles on liver aging, authored by 24034 contributors from 4092 institutions across 85 countries. Notably, the years 1991 and 2020 presented significant bursts in publication output. The United States led in terms of publications (n = 1008, 25.1%), citations (n = 55205), and international collaborations (multiple country publications = 214). Keywords such as “lipid metabolism”, “fatty liver disease”, “inflammation”, “liver fibrosis” and “target” were prominent, highlighting the current research hotspots. Notably, the top 64 genes, each of which appeared in at least 8 articles, were involved in pathways essential for cell survival and aging, including the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B, Forkhead box O and p53 signaling pathways. CONCLUSION This study highlights key areas of liver aging and offers a comprehensive overview of research trends, as well as insights into potential value for collaborative pursuits and clinical implementations. ©The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Phyllosphere endophytes play a critical role in a myriad of biological functions, such as maintaining plant health and overall fitness. They play a determinative role in crop yield and quality by regulating vital processes, such as leaf functionality and longevity, seed mass, apical growth, flowering, and fruit development. This study conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis aiming to review the prevailing research trajectories in phyllosphere endophytes and harness both primary areas of interest and emerging challenges. A total of 156 research articles on phyllosphere endophytes, published between 2002 and 2022, were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). A systematic analysis was conducted using CiteSpace to visualize the evolution of publication frequency, the collaboration network, the co-citation network, and keywords co-occurrence. The findings indicated that initially, there were few publications on the topic of phyllosphere endophytes. However, from 2011 onwards, there was a notable increase in the number of publications on phyllosphere endophytes, gaining worldwide attention. Among authors, Arnold, A Elizabeth is widely recognized as a leading author in this research area. In terms of countries, the USA and China hold the highest rankings. As for institutional ranking, the University of Arizona is the most prevalent and leading institute in this particular subject. Collaborative efforts among the authors and institutions tend to be confined to small groups, and a large-scale collaborative network needs to be established. This study identified the influential journals, literature, and hot research topics. These findings also highlight the interconnected nature of key themes, e.g., phyllosphere endophyte research revolves around the four pillars: diversity, fungal endophytes, growth, and endophytic fungi. This study provides an in-depth perspective on phyllosphere endophytes studies, revealing the identification of biodiversity and microbial interaction of phyllosphere endophytes as the principal research frontiers. These analytical findings not only elucidate the recent trajectory of phyllosphere endophyte research but also provide invaluable insights for similar studies and their potential applications on a global scale. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Collaboration has become crucial in solving scientific problems in biomedical and health sciences. There is a growing interest in applying social network analysis to professional associations aiming to leverage expertise and resources for optimal synergy. As a set of computational and statistical methods for analyzing social networks, exponential random graph models (ERGMs) examine complex collaborative networks due to their uniqueness of allowing for non-independent variables in network modeling. This study took a review approach to collect and analyze ERGM applications in health sciences by following the protocol of a systematic review. We included a total of 30 studies. The bibliometric characteristics revealed significant authors, institutions, countries, funding agencies, and citation impact associated with the publications. In addition, we observed five types of ERGMs for network modeling (standard ERGM and its extensions—Bayesian ERGM, temporal ERGM, separable temporal ERGM, and multilevel ERGM). Most studies (80%) used the standard ERGM, which possesses only endogenous and exogenous variables examining either micro- (individual-based) or macro-level (organization-based) collaborations without exploring how the links between individuals and organizations contribute to the overall network structure. Our findings help researchers (a) understand the extant research landscape of ERGM applications in health sciences, (b) learn to control and predict connection occurrence in a collaborative network, and (c) better design ERGM-applied studies to examine complex relations and social system structure, which is native to professional collaborations. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - Seagrass beds, as an important coastal blue carbon ecosystem, are excellent at storing organic carbon and mitigating the impacts of global climate change. However, seagrass beds are under threat due to increased human activities and ubiquitous presence of microplastics (MPs) in marine environments. Bibliometric analysis shows that the distribution and accumulation of microplastics in seagrass beds has been widely documented worldwide, but their impacts on seagrass beds, particularly on carbon sequestration capacity, have not been given sufficient attention. This review aims to outline the potential impacts of MPs on the carbon sequestration capacity of seagrass ecosystems across five key aspects: (1) MPs act as sources of organic carbon, contributing to direct pollution in seagrass ecosystems; (2) Impacts of MPs on seagrasses and their epiphytic algae, affecting plant growth and net primary productivity; (3) Impacts of MPs on microorganisms, influencing production of recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon and greenhouse gas; (4) Impacts of MPs on seagrass sediments, altering the quality, structure, properties and decomposition processes of plant litters; (5) Other complex impacts on the seagrass ecosystems, depending on different behaviors of MPs. Latest progress in these fields are summarized and recommendations for future work are discussed. This review can provide valuable insights to facilitate future multidisciplinary investigations and encourage society-wide implementation of effective conservation measures to enhance the carbon sequestration capacity of seagrass beds. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Climate change and sustainable development drive transformation in economic development models. Carbon emission reduction and the circular economy propel climate change and sustainable development, yet it's unclear if they synergize or counteract each other. This study examines the question from theoretical and practical perspectives. Using a theory-practice framework, bibliometric and big data analyses were conducted on the Web of Science and Chinese case data, totaling 2.29GB, to explore synergies between carbon emission reduction and the circular economy. The study finds predominantly synergistic interactions between the circular economy and carbon emission reduction, with minimal offsetting effects. That is, the circular economy markedly enhances carbon emissions reduction. At the theoretical level, the two fields are gradually evolving towards in-depth research, while at the practical level, collaboration is coalescing around four areas: hot fields, potential fields, auxiliary fields and common goals. A noteworthy contribution of this study is the development of a framework that synergizes theory and practice, providing a structured approach for future research in this domain. By quantifying the synergistic and offsetting relationship between the circular economy and carbon emissions reduction through systematic big data analysis, this research offers insights essential for achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. We also stress the need for diverse case studies and multi-dimensional analyses in ongoing research. © 2024

AB  - Background: Substance abuse, particularly tobacco smoking, is a significant global public health concern. Efforts have been made to reduce smoking prevalence and promote cessation, but challenges, such as nicotine addiction, marketing tactics by tobacco industry, and cultural acceptability hinder progress. Technology has emerged as a potential tool to address these challenges by providing innovative scalable interventions. The objective of the study was to analyze and map scientific literature on technology-based intervention for tobacco prevention and treatment. Methods: A bibliometric methodology was conducted. Scopus database was used to retrieve relevant research articles published between 2003 and 2022. The analysis included publication trends, key contributors, research hotspots, research themes, the most impactful articles, and emerging research topics. Results: A total of 639 articles were found, with a slow and fluctuating growth pattern observed after 2011. The Journal of Medical Internet Research was the most prominent journal in the field. The United States was the leading country in the field, followed up by the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Research hotspots included smoking cessation, randomized controlled trials, and technology-based methods such as internet, mHealth, smartphone apps, text messages, and social media. Four primary research themes were identified: development of smartphone applications, efficacy of text messaging interventions, acceptance and effectiveness of smartphone applications, and interventions targeting young adults and students using mobile phone and social media platforms. The top 10 cited articles demonstrated effectiveness of digital interventions in promoting smoking cessation rates and reducing relapse rates. Emerging research topics included the use of virtual reality interventions, interventions for specific populations through personalized tools, and technology-based interventions in non-Western countries. Conclusions: The findings of the current study highlight the potential of technology to address the challenges associated with tobacco smoking. Further future research in this area is warranted to continue advancing the field and developing effective and evidence-based interventions to combat tobacco smoking. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This article analyzed research on the relationship between School, Physical Education (PE) and Ethnoeducation, which allows us to offer an overview of how PE articulates ethnic aspects within the school curriculum in favor of the conservation of cultural identity. The study reviewed scientific databases, between the years 2018 and 2022. The methodology assumed bibliometric analysis and documentary review that took into account the following steps: establishing the research design; carry out information management and implementation; finally, communicate the results, which provide conceptual elements for the initial dissertation around the relationship between School, PE, and ethno-education, these scenarios being conducive to human formation, in which experiences of social exclusion and inclusion are perceived; At the same time, they highlight the hegemony that has been established in PE curricula through its contents and pedagogical practices. Therefore, ethnoeducation appears as an opportunity to articulate and make visible manifestations and practices of ethnic cultures within the area of PE. © Copyright: Federación Española de Asociaciones de Docentes de Educación Física.

AB  - Background: There are limited comprehensive bibliometric analyses that have examined research articles using the 24-h movement guidelines, which are necessary to evaluate the impact of the research field, map the scientific structure of the research landscape, and identify knowledge gaps. Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyse the published research articles using the 24-h movement guidelines and assess their bibliometric characteristics. Methods: The search was conducted across all databases indexed in the Web of Science on March 6, 2024, and the bibliometric characteristics of studies published from 2016 onwards were analysed. Descriptive statistics and visualisations by the VOSviewer were used for the presentation of bibliometric characteristics. Results: 120 studies using the 24-h movement guidelines in children and adolescents were included for analysis in this study. In general, number of the related publications using the 24-h movement guidelines increased from 2016 until now. 16 distinct clusters of author networking were displayed, of which the Canadian team was the strongest cluster with the highest research impacts. Of the included studies, cross-sectional studies accounted for the majority. North America and Europe were the leading two study locations across the included studies. Highly varied adherence rate to the 24-h movement guidelines across the included studies were observed. In terms of correlates and health outcomes of meeting the 24-h movement guidelines, separately, sociodemographic and health functioning characteristics were the most examined aspects. Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive scientific overview for research using the 24-h movement guidelines in children and adolescents, which may help guide potential research directions to improve the low compliance rates in this population. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Seagrass sediment is intricately linked to their ecological functions, collectively forming the foundation of the seagrass ecosystem, and providing a range of essential ecosystem services, underscoring their significant research importance. This study aims to analyze the emerging hotspots and evolving trends in research on seagrass sediment over the past two decades (2003–2023), identify current research gaps, and forecast future directions for investigation. We extracted data from 3,390 studies identified in the Web of Science that have published pivotal research on seagrass sediment. Over this period, investigations into seagrass sediment have progressively transitioned from focusing on seagrass ecology to examining global change impacts on these sediments, ultimately shifting towards blue carbon research. Notably, there remains a paucity of studies addressing the sediments of small and tropical seagrasses. Furthermore, while the sedimentation mechanisms related to seagrasses represent an active area of inquiry, comprehensive analyses regarding these mechanisms are still limited. This study underscores the critical need for further exploration into sedimentation processes involving seagrasses as well as calls for enhanced integration within blue carbon ecosystem sediment studies pertaining to seagrass habitats. © 2024

AB  - The academic discourse surrounding tourism's interdisciplinary approach has long piqued the interest of the scholarly community. More recently, attention has pivoted towards the intersection of neuroscience and neuromarketing within the realm of tourism, giving rise to the concept of “neurotourism”. This emergence requires a comprehensive elucidation of the relevance of neuromarketing and neuroscience to the field of tourism, thereby addressing the imperative to bridge existing knowledge gaps. In light of this, the present paper endeavours to fulfil this objective by synthesizing global research in this domain. The study adopts an interdisciplinary approach, employing a hybrid systematic review methodology that encompasses a literature review encompassing nine key indicators and a bibliometric analysis through co-word analysis of author keywords. In total, our investigation unearthed 45 papers from Scopus, each exploring the application of neuroscience and neuromarketing theories and methods within the context of tourism. Among these, three papers delve into the concept of neurotourism. In this paper, we underscore the deep connection between neuroscience, neuroscientific methodologies, and neuromarketing within the realm of tourism research. The outcomes of this research significantly enhance our comprehension of the current state of neurotourism research, revealing both existing voids and emerging areas of interest. Furthermore, this study introduces a pioneering methodological approach, fusing Scival topic prominence and hybrid systematic review techniques into bibliometric analysis. Ultimately, our findings illuminate a notable research lacuna, presenting a fertile terrain for prospective investigations. Additionally, we deliberate on current trends and propose directions for future research within the neurotourism landscape. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - This study presents a comprehensive bibliometric review of hybrid offshore renewable energy sources (HORES) and their optimization methods over the past 24 years. The analysis highlights a significant increase in global publications on HORES, reflecting increasing demand on the resource utilization and environmental sustainability. Specifically, the number of publications on HORES has increased by approximately 70% from 2000 to 2023, indicating rising interest and research activity in this area. The findings show that classical optimization methods are reliable for optimization. However, the methods face limitations due to restricted parameters. In comparison, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms provide optimal solutions with rapid convergence but require substantial computational resources. Hybrid optimization methods combine the strengths of both classical and AI methods. This methods are evolving as a promising solution to these challenges. Potential research directions include the enhancement of hybrid optimization methods, integrated engineering collaboration, mixing of emerging technologies, and conducting long-term impact studies are proposed. These efforts are crucial for advancing the field of ORES and achieving sustainable power production. © 2024

AB  - Exercise elicits a wide range of physiological responses in mammalian tissues that enhance a broad range of functions, particularly in improving cognitive performance. However, the field lacks a comprehensive bibliometric analysis that clarifies its knowledge structure and research hotspots. This study aims to address this gap and map the research landscape regarding the role of exercise in cognitive function enhancement. Firstly, the frequencies and co-occurrence of keywords were analysed to identify six main clusters: aging, cognitive impairment, rehabilitation, obesity, fatigue, and hippocampus. Secondly, reference timeline co-citation analysis revealed that hippocampus and aging were the major bursts with high intensity and long attention span while children had recently emerged as a topical subject. Finally, the evolution of themes from 2012 to 2022 was analysed, and found that older adults had been the leading research theme for exercise affecting cognition. Childhood obesity was an emerging theme that attracted increasing research attention in recent years while the hippocampus research theme expanded rapidly during the decade but remained a niche topic with less relevance to others. This research identified and summarised research priorities and evolutionary trends in exercise to improve cognition by constructing knowledge networks through visual analysis. It provides researchers with a comprehensive insight into the current state of the field to facilitate further research. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Since the Industrial Revolution, massive carbon dioxide emissions from human activities have caused global warming. Forest carbon sink play a crucial role in mitigating climate change, with soil being a key component of forest ecosystem carbon pools. Both carbon source and carbon sink in forest soils have attracted significant academic interest. This paper uses bibliometrics to review and compare studies on forest soil carbon sink and source from January 1996 to April 4, 2024, divided into three stages, namely initial (1996-2004), middle (2005-2014), and late (2015-2024) stages. We found that publications on forest soil carbon source far exceed those on carbon sink, with a significant correlation in their trends. The United States leads in publication numbers, while the United Kingdom has greater centrality. Chinese institutions dominate in publication numbers, excelling in collaborative research. In forest soil carbon sink research, the top ten most-cited articles focus on climate change, soil respiration, and large-scale surveys. For forest soil carbon source, the focus is on climate change and soil organic matter. The research on carbon sink lags behind carbon source, and many hotspot issues remain unresolved. Over the three periods, studies on forest soil carbon sink and source have advanced in technological methods, greenhouse gases, ecosystem types, and ecosystem processes and functions. This study provides data to assist researchers in designing targeted and practical project schemes, while guiding policymakers to prioritize support for high-potential forest soil carbon projects, ultimately enhancing fund utilization efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Introduction: The relative citation ratio (RCR) is a bibliometric index utilized to assess research productivity. Mean relative citation ratio (m-RCR) and weighted relative citation ratio (w-RCR) can be utilized to assess individual research quality as well as career-long productivity, respectively. We sought to determine differences in academic productivity between genders and identify demographic variables associated with increased academic productivity. Methods: A list of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery residency programs was compiled utilizing the American Council of Academic Plastic Surgeons website. Each program department's website was utilized to generate a list of practicing surgeons and respective demographic information. Both mean and weighted RCR were obtained using the iCite, a National Institutes of Health bibliometric tool. Surgeons were excluded if any demographic or RCR data was not accessible. Chi-squared test, Mann–Whitney U test, Kruskal–Wallis test, and multivariable linear regressions were performed. Results: A total of 785 academic plastic surgeons met the criteria and were included in the analysis, 186 of whom were women and 599 men. Both academic rank and model of residency training were significantly associated with gender in chi-squared analysis (P < 0.05). Mean relative citation ratio was higher among men in departments. Mean w-RCR was higher among men of assistant professor status, chief/chairperson status, integrated model of residency training, faculty size ≥six and in departments and divisions. Academic rank and faculty size were associated with higher w-RCR upon multivariable linear regression. Conclusions: Although differences exist in mean w-RCR between men and women in plastic surgery, gender is not a predictor of increased academic productivity. RCR is an accurate means of assessing gender differences in academic productivity as it comprehensively considers both quality and quantity of research and may be superior to other, older bibliometric indices. © 2024

AB  - The field of conceptual modeling has now been in existence for over five decades. To understand how this field has evolved and should continue to evolve, it is useful to examine the contributions made over time and the themes that have emerged. In this research, we apply bibliometric analysis to a corpus of over 4700 research papers spanning from 1976 to 2023. We successively apply co-citation, bibliographic coupling, and main path analysis. Co-citation and citation networks are produced that surface the intellectual structure of the field, the main themes, and the relationships among major and influential research papers over time. We identify four areas in the intellectual structure of the field: conceptual modeling and databases; grammars and guidelines for conceptual modeling; requirements engineering and information systems design methodologies; and ontology constructs for conceptual modeling. Between 2017 and 2023, we distinguish nine research themes, including domain-specific conceptual modeling and applications, ontologies and applications, genomics, and datastores and multi-model data. The main path analysis identifies several trajectories among the major and most influential papers. This leads to insights into the lineage of key, influential papers in conceptual modeling research. The primordial nature of the main paths identified encompasses two important aspects. The first revolves around refining and complementing the entity-relationship model. The second identifies the contribution of ontologies for conceptual modeling to make the models more robust. Based on the findings from this bibliometric analysis, we propose several directions for future conceptual modeling research. © 2024

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease is one common type of dementia. Numerous studies have suggested a correlation between Alzheimer's disease and inflammation. Microglia mainly participate in the inflammatory response in the brain. Currently, ample evidence has shown that microglia are closely related to the occurrence and development of Alzheimer's disease. Objective: We opted for bibliometric analysis to comprehensively summarize the advancements in the study of microglia in Alzheimer's disease, aiming to provide researchers with current trends and future research directions. Methods: All articles and reviews pertaining to microglia in Alzheimer's disease from 2000 to 2022 were downloaded through Web of Science Core Collection. The results were subjected to bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer 1.6.18 and CiteSpace 6.1 R2. Results: Overall, 7449 publications were included. The number of publications was increasing yearly. The United States has published the most publications. Harvard Medical School has published the most papers of all institutions. Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease and Journal of Neuroscience were the journals with the most studies and the most commonly cited, respectively. Mt Heneka is the author with the highest productivity and co-citation. After analysis, the most common keywords are neuroinflammation, amyloid-beta, inflammation, neurodegeneration. Gut microbiota, extracellular vesicle, dysfunction and meta-analysis are the hotspots of research at the present stage and are likely to continue. Conclusion: NLRP3 inflammasome, TREM2, gut microbiota, mitochondrial dysfunction, exosomes are research hotspots. The relationship between microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's disease have been the focus of current research and the development trend of future research. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are a developing concern in marine environments, with scientists concentrating more on their effects on various creatures. Sea cucumbers (SCs), as suspension and deposit feeders, are expected to be exposed to and consume MPs in their habitat. The purpose of this methodical review is to gather and integrate accessible research on the presence and effects of MPs on SCs. A systematic search of relevant databases yielded relevant papers exploring the occurrence of MPs in SC habitats as well as the possible effects of MP intake on SCs. Bibliometric analysis was also conducted to collect and analyze a large volume of data. Then the papers were sorted (a total of 249) related to the occurrence and effects of MPs in SCs. Finally, targeted data were collected from the articles for the study. The review emphasizes the ubiquity of MPs in SC ecosystems, citing studies that found high quantities in coastal areas and sediment. MPs have a variety of effects on SCs, with some studies indicating that they lower eating efficiency, affect behavior, and cause tissue damage. However, there is still no unanimity on the overall effects of MP exposure on SCs. This review gives a complete summary of the present state of information about the incidence and impact of MPs on SCs, highlighting the need for additional study in this area. Understanding the possible dangers of MPs on SCs is critical for the survival of these ecologically significant creatures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Over the past decade, a substantial body of research exploring soundscapes in religious historical buildings has emerged, yet a comprehensive summary of this work is lacking. This paper selects 74 typical studies of soundscapes in religious historical buildings published between 2011 and 2022 to conduct quantitative statistics and visualization analysis from a bibliometric perspective. The selected literature is categorized based on the type of religious building, Christian, Islamic, or Buddhist. The literature is further segmented according to the research subject, including sound field studies, sound analyses, and evaluations of the acoustic environment. The research methods employed are also differentiated and include sound field measurements, acoustic simulations, questionnaires and auralization procedures. The analysis reveals pronounced disparities in research foci depending on the type of religious historical building. For instance, studies on the soundscape in Christian churches tend to focus on objective sound field attributes and frequently employ sound field simulations to analyse the acoustic parameters of diverse church spaces and materials. Conversely, research on the soundscape in Islamic mosques prioritizes speech intelligibility and acoustic comfort, while studies of the soundscape of Buddhist temples gravitate towards the impact of natural and religious sounds on individuals. This paper anticipates the future direction of soundscape research on religious historical buildings. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: In recent years, the impact of diet on Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a modifiable lifestyle has attracted widespread attention. We aimed to elucidate the current research status, frontiers, and research trends regarding the role of diet in AD over the past two decades through CiteSpace. Methods: Studies related to AD and diet that were published from January 1, 2003, to June 30, 2023, were retrieved via the Web of Science Core Collection. We imported the study data into CiteSpace for visual analysis of countries, institutions, co-authors, and co-occurring keywords. Results: A total of 922 relevant studies were included in our analysis, which found Nikolaos Scarmeas was the most prolific author (13 studies, 1.41%). The results also indicated that USA and Columbia University were the country and institution with the highest number of publications, with 209 (22.67%) and 23 (2.49%), respectively. The keywords that had a burst in the past four years were neuroinflammation, AD, tau, association, and beta. Conclusion: Talent exchange and regional cooperation are recommended in this study field. The results indicate that the effectiveness of various dietary patterns and mechanisms of dietary interventions using biomarkers and supplementation with refined nutrients will be the main research trends in the future. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - As an electrochemical advanced oxidation process, the electro-Fenton (EF) process has gained significant importance in the treatment of wastewater and persistent organic pollutants in recent years. As recently reported in a bibliometric analysis, the number of scientific publications on EF have increased exponentially since 2002, reaching nearly 500 articles published in 2022 (Deng et al., 2022). The influence of the main operating parameters has been thoroughly investigated for optimization purposes, such as type of electrode materials, reactor design, current density, and type and concentration of catalyst. Even though most of the studies have been conducted at a laboratory scale, focusing on fundamental aspects and their applications to degrade specific pollutants and treat real wastewater, important large-scale attempts have also been made. This review presents and discusses the most recent advances of the EF process with special emphasis on the aspects more closely related to future implementations at the large scale, such as applications to treat real effluents (industrial and municipal wastewaters) and soil remediation, development of large-scale reactors, costs and effectiveness evaluation, and life cycle assessment. Opportunities and perspectives related to the heterogeneous EF process for real applications are also discussed. This review article aims to be a critical and exhaustive overview of the most recent developments for large-scale applications, which seeks to arouse the interest of a large scientific community and boost the development of EF systems in real environments. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Acupuncture has been increasingly used in obese people, yet no bibliometric analysis of acupuncture studies for obesity exists. This bibliometric study analyzed research trends, cooperation, and knowledge dissemination on acupuncture for obesity over the past 20 years to inform future directions. Objectives: To investigate the characteristics, hotspots, and frontiers of global scientific output in acupuncture research for obesity over the past two decades. Methods: We retrieved publications on acupuncture for obesity published from 2004 to 2023 from the Web of Science Core Collection. Using Citespace, VOSviewer, and Bibliometrix, we analyzed and visualized the publications, countries, institutions, authors, journals, and keywords from various angles. Results: A total of 357 articles were retrieved. The results showed that the number of annual publications on acupuncture for obesity has increased over time. China had the most publications (217 articles, 60.87 %), with Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (24 articles, 6.72 %) as the most prolific institution. Ergene Neyhan, Huang Wei, and Zhou Zhongyu were the most productive authors (9 articles), and the article published by Cho SH in 2009 was the most cited article (60 citations). The most published journal was Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine, while the Journal of American Journal of Chinese Medicine was the most frequently cited. Recently, “electroacupuncture” “insulin resistance” and “systematic review” appeared frequently. The research hotspots and trends of acupuncture for obesity mainly focus on interventions, hotspot diseases, and mechanism exploration. According to keyword analysis, randomized controlled trials of catgut embedding and mechanistic studies of gut flora are the trends for future research. Conclusion: Although China is the leading producer, multinational co-operation still needs to be strengthened. Currently, the main interventions for obesity were acupuncture and electroacupuncture, and the hot diseases were obesity combined with polycystic ovary syndrome and metabolic syndrome. In addition, randomised controlled trials of catgut embedding and mechanistic studies of gut flora may be potential directions for future research in the field of acupuncture for obesity. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Macrofungi (or mushrooms) are essential for agriculture, food, and ecology. Although research on the growth and development of macrofungi (GDM) can provide insights into their biological characteristics and metabolite synthesis mechanisms, further exploration is needed for a systematic and visual analysis of the current research progress on GDM. To comprehensively understand the research status and development trend of GDM, a total of 545 scientific literature related to GDM in the Web of Science Core Collection database from 2008 to 2024 were searched and selected as research objects. The general information (publication year, country, institution, and cited journal) and the specific information (co-authorship, keyword co-occurrence, and references with strong citation bursts) were mined and visualized in detail based on CiteSpace software. These analyses demonstrated that related research is still fashionable, and China is dominant and influential in this field. More frequent and in-depth cooperation among authors, institutions and regions is conducive to promoting the research on GDM. Additionally, the quantity and cluster analyses of keywords and references demonstrated that medicinal/edible macrofungi and sustainable development (e.g. mushroom substrate reuse) may be research hotspots and will remain popular in the coming years. This research aims to supply researchers with up-to-date knowledge and cutting-edge issues related to GDM by providing a visually appealing representations on quantitative GDM studies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - 【Abstract】 Background In the face of the surge of primary studies within a certain period of time，the traditional time-consuming systematic review method is difficult to provide evidence-based basis for clinical practice. Rapid review（RR），as an extension of systematic review，can integrate existing research in a limited time to meet the need for rapid decision-making. Currently，RR has been widely used in the field of medical research，but its application status remains unclear. Objective To explore the current status and hotspot of RR research by using bibliometric analysis. Method CNKI and WOS databases were searched for the researches in the field of RR application from 2001 to 2023，a visualization analysis was performed on annual publication volume，countries，institutions，authors，journals，and keywords of Chinese and English literature by the bibliometrics software of VOSviewer and CiteSpace. Results A total of 151 articles in Chinese and 1197 in English were included. The publication volume of RR application increased gradually from 2001 to 2023，but the publication volume in foreign was higher than that in China，with more obvious increasing trend. The United Kingdom was the country with the highest publication volume（252），the University of Toronto in Canada was the institution with the highest publication volume（52），and Peking University Third Hospital ranked first in publication volume in China（23）. The journal Evaluation and Analysis of Drug-use in Hospitals of China had the highest publication volume in China（22），and the journal BMJ Open had the highest publication volume abroad（42）. In China，the author team mainly composed of MEN Peng，ZHAI Suodi and ZHAO Zinan published more research. In foreign，the authors of NUSSBAUMER-STREIT，GARTLEHNER and TRICCO published more studies. The most frequently cited literature in China was mainly about RR application and methodology，rapid assessments of drugs or technologies，and the impact of COVID-19，while the most frequently cited literature in foreign was mainly about the the impact，intervention，and epidemiological factors of COVID-19，or methodological studies of RR. Domestic research hotspots mainly focused on the field of rapid health technology assessment in the safety，efficacy，and cost effectiveness of intervention for chronic or serious diseases. Foreign research hotspots mainly focused on the etiology，intervention，diagnosis，prevention，and impact of COVID-19，and rapid evidence synthesis related to decision-making，such as the safety and effectiveness of the drug intervention in children，health care，cancer treatment or mortality risk in middle-aged and elderly populations. Conclusion At present，there is a great difference in the development of RR application in the medical field at home and abroad. The application of RR in foreign is gradually maturing，but in China，it is still in the preliminary stage. The experience of RR application in foreign can be learned to expand the development of domestic RR application. © Editorial Office of Chinese General Practice.

AB  - Objectives: This study utilizes visual analysis methods to retrospectively examine the evolution and trends in exercise interventions for knee osteoarthritis (KOA) research from 2011 to 2022. Design: Bibliometric and visualization analysis review. Setting and Participants: Using the Web of Science database, the literature search range is from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2022, with the language specified as English and document type set to Article. Methods: Visual analysis was used to analyze literature in the field of exercise interventions for KOA, with KOA and exercise interventions as the key search terms. Visualization maps for countries/regions were created using Tableau and Scimago Graphica software. Institutional, author, and keyword visualization maps were drawn using CiteSpace and VOSviewer software. Results: In total, 3137 articles were included in the visual analysis. The United States emerged as the leading country in terms of publication volume and contribution. Moreover, developed countries such as the United States, Australia, United Kingdom, and Canada have established close and stable cooperative relationships. The University of Melbourne stood out as the institution with both the highest publication volume and centrality. At the forefront of research output in this field was Bennell K.L. from the University of Melbourne. The journal with the highest co-citation frequency was Osteoarthritis and Cartilage. The keyword clustering map highlighted an evolution in the field of exercise interventions for KOA, emphasizing 8 key research themes spanning knee osteoarthritis, serum cartilage, osteoarthritis initiative, patellofemoral pain, total knee arthroplasty, exercise-induced hypoalgesia, isometric exercise, and anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Burst analysis revealed that older adult was the earliest and most prominent keyword, with contemporary topics such as patellofemoral pain, safety, musculoskeletal disorder, and neuromuscular exercise considered as research hotspots and future directions in this field. Conclusions and Implications: The global attention on exercise interventions for KOA research is expanding, emphasizing the importance of strengthened connections among developing countries and collaborative author groups. Recent trends have shifted toward topics such as neuromuscular training, treatment safety, and musculoskeletal disorders, whereas research interest in patellofemoral pain remains unabated. Neuromuscular training for KOA represents the current frontier in this field. Future research should delve into the effects of diverse types of exercise interventions for KOA on neuromuscular injury and recovery, exploring feasibility and safety to formulate personalized exercise plans for patients with KOA. © 2024 Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medical Association

AB  - A bibliometric analysis was conducted in April 2024 to review the current trends in otoplasty. It involved a literature search of the Scopus database for original articles with the query terms “otoplasty” and “pinnaplasty,” without restricting publication dates or selecting journals in the database. The top 100 articles with the highest citations were reviewed. Bibliometric analysis was performed with the Scimago journal impact factor. The screening was done following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to extract the top 100 most-cited articles in otoplasty. We excluded articles not focused on otoplasty, those involving other surgical procedures, and non-English articles. With Scopus and manual screening, we performed citation analysis of selected articles. Mean values were calculated for the number of citations and citations per year. Of the 951 studies identified, 100 (10.5%) were analyzed in detail. The studies were published between 1941 and 2024, with a mean of 36 ± 23.7 citations per paper. The journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery reported the highest number (23%, n = 23) of articles, followed by the Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery with 13% (n = 13) articles. The highest number of articles originated from the United States (38%, n = 38), followed by the United Kingdom (15%, n = 15). Our bibliometric analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the landscape of otoplasty research, highlighting key publications, authors, and journals. This study contributes to the understanding of the evolution and impact of otoplasty literature, laying the groundwork for further research and innovation in this field. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This study offers a typology of the Social Innovation (SI) field. A sample of 5,152 documents from the Scopus database is screened using a clustering process. Using measures for inferring similarities from co-occurrence data, we identified the main themes addressed in the field, presenting a collection of keywords structured into clusters and categories. Bibliographic coupling and co-citation clustering find significant related documents and the VOS algorithm maps two sets of relevant clusters. The maps of these bibliometric analyses were contrasted through an analytical process identifying and classifying the research questions in each. This combined methodology proposes a typology that contributes to the integration of the different disciplines that structure the field by bridging the boundaries of the knowledge areas generated during the conceptualisation process. The typology confirms a matrix of six consolidated disciplines (transformation, social entrepreneurship, design, theory, territorial development, and governance) as well as three emerging clusters, a human cluster related to demographic challenges and two central sets bringing together specific aspects of social technologies and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This classification provides a picture of the current intellectual structure of the field, pulling together publications relevant to the different academic communities and providing clarity and a more manageable approach to handling the large volume of information faced when designing and substantiating systematic studies and future research on SI. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is a common cranial nerve disease. In HFS research, we conducted a bibliometric analysis to examine the development and research trends. A retrieval of HFS studies published between 2011 and 2022 was performed from the Web of Science Core Collection in September 2022. Two scientometric tools were used to perform bibliometric and visualization-based analyses: VOSviewer and CiteSpace. Bibliometric analysis of 1461 studies published between 2011 and 2022 was carried out using data from 444 journals, 6021 authors, 1732 institutions, and 76 countries/regions. China, the USA, Japan, and South Korea were four key contributors to this study. Shanghai Jiaotong University was the major institution with the larger number of publications. Li Shiting was the most prolific author. Jannetta PJ was the most co-cited author. World Neurosurgery was the top prolific journal. Journal of Neurosurgery was the top co-cited journal. The top five keywords were hemifacial spasm, microvascular decompression, trigeminal neuralgia, surgery, and neurovascular compression. This study examines the research trends in global scientific research on HFS over the last decade. Researchers interested in learning more about current trends and novel research frontiers in this area can benefit from the study. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the portrayal of publishing patterns and the evolution of scholarly discourse of sports sociology publications. This study relies on the Scopus and WoS databases to compile the publications on sports sociology. In this study, ScientoPy and VOSviewer were used fervently to construct science mapping and visualisation networks in a flash. There were 516 publications in the Scopus database, whereas 216 were in the WoS. Thus, the total number of publications between 1990 and 2022 was 732, or 79.13% of the total. The top two countries, with over 100 publications each, are the United States and Germany. The keyword “Sports sociology” is closely associated with “development,” “athlete”, and “physical education”, which has emerged significantly since 2015. This study should pave the way for future initiatives to enhance and stimulate sports sociology research. Thus, sports sociologists should be concerned about new insights, such as the relationship between sports sociology and mental health, gender disparities, sports injury care, and artificial intelligence. Intriguingly, the social components of physical education and sports training are significant for human daily activities, behaviour, and emotions. © Copyright: Federación Española de Asociaciones de Docentes de Educación Física (FEADEF)

AB  - Inadequate municipal solid waste (MSW) management threatens public health and the environment. The waste-to-energy (WtE) route allows the production of electricity, heat, and other valuable chemical products. WtE consists of incineration, gasification, pyrolysis, and some emerging technologies. This study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to conduct a bibliometric analysis of WtE technologies for MSW management research. Scopus-indexed articles were examined between 1971 and 2023. Four periods were defined and analyzed in terms of their most significant results. In addition, the most pertinent journals (Waste Management, Chemosphere, and Waste Management & Research) ranked first, second, and third, respectively. Moreover, the top contributor countries include one in America (the United States), three in Asia (China, Japan, and India), and five in Europe (Spain, Italy, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom). Throughout a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) case study, the environmental performance of gasification and incineration were compared as relevant technologies for treating MSW were contrasted. Gasification excelled in seven environmental parameters, suggesting that developing strategies for MSW gasification on a commercial scale should prioritize this aspect. Finally, the energy potential was assessed, which provided valuable information on the societal benefits of WtE technologies in various sectors, such as education, health, and electromobility. Under their respective contexts, stakeholders should enhance MSW sorting policies, pretreatment methods, and emerging valorization options. The growing global interest in WtE requires a social, environmental, and economic evaluation before implementation. © 2024

AB  - Supporting the birth and development of innovative small firms, i.e., start-up incubation, has emerged as a critical factor in fostering entrepreneurship, innovation, regional development, and more recently, sustainability. This bibliometric review aims to comprehensively understand and visualize different research perspectives on how start-ups are successfully incubated. A total of 1116 Scopus articles were selected and synthesized using a qualitative approach. The study applies novel visualization techniques (Citation Network Analysis, Global Citation Score, Burst Detection Analysis and Co-Occurrence Networks of Keywords) to map the scientific structure of start-up incubation research, including the clusters of the leading research topics based on citation networks, the most cited articles, and the keywords with the most substantial citation bursts as well as their co-occurrence. We evaluate research on start-up incubation from 1972 to 2023 and show how the topic has advanced by scholars’ changing interests over time. We identify five clusters that reflect distinct study themes and their most cited references. The findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the evolution of start-up incubation research, which developed from a focus on biotechnology and technology transfer toward the current research trends on accelerators and (entrepreneurial) ecosystems. This paper also provides insights for policymakers and start-up incubation managers to make informed decisions. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - While gender mainstreaming (GM) is globally recognized as a key strategy for realizing gender equality and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, the evolution and development of GM research have yet to be analyzed. This article fills this gap in knowledge by undertaking a bibliometric analysis of the GM literature based on 1590 documents extracted from two of the most extensive databases, Scopus and Web of Science (WoS). Our findings reveal a significant growth in GM research since 1997, particularly between 2017 and 2022. Global North countries, such as the UK, Spain, and the USA, lead GM research output, while the Global South countries, except South Africa and India, have a relatively small share in this field. International collaboration in GM research appears weak, with most countries collaborating within their own borders and geographical vicinity. GM has predominantly been researched in relation to public policy and decision-making, while research involving international human rights, peacekeeping, higher education, teaching, and curriculum is still developing. These emerging themes offer opportunities for researchers to align their future research agendas within GM. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Given the limited availability of bibliometric and visual analysis on the topic of romantic love, the primary objective of the current study is to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive visual analysis of relevant literature. Through this analysis, the current study aimed to uncover current research trends and identify potential future directions in the field of romantic love. The current study’s search criteria were met by an impressive 6858 publications found in the Web of Science database for the period between 2013 and 2022. A thorough analysis was conducted on the bibliographic visualization of the authors, organizations, countries, references, and keywords. Over time, there has been a remarkable surge in the number of significant publications. Among the authors in the field of romantic love, Emily A. Impett has emerged as the most prolific. The Journal of Social and Personal Relationships is indeed one of the top journals that has published a significant number of articles on the topic of romantic love. During the preceding decade, the University of California System emerged as a prominent producer of publications centered around romantic love, solidifying the United States’ position as a dominant player in this field. In recent times, there has been a significant surge in the popularity of keywords such as “same-sex,” “conflict resolution,” and “social relationships” within academic literature. These topics have experienced a burst of attention, as evidenced by a substantial increase in references and citations. Through the use of visualization maps and analysis of key publications, the current study offers a comprehensive overview of the key concepts and potential avenues for future research in the field of romantic love. Gaining a deep understanding of the complex dynamics and societal implications of romantic love has been instrumental in formulating policies that embody increased compassion and support. As a result, these policies have played a pivotal role in fostering resilient familial ties and contributing to the enduring stability and prosperity of our social fabric. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Family medicine has been recognized as a medical specialty in Thailand. However, there is a lack of information about scholarly publications. Bibliometric analysis is a valuable methodology for identifying research trends and knowledge gaps in this field. This study aims to analyze scholarly publications related to family medicine in Thailand. Method: This bibliometric analysis was conducted based on the PubMed search in March 2023. All relevant literature related to 'family medicine' and 'Thailand' was retrieved. Performance analysis examined the publication trends from 1963 to 2023, the top 10 journals publishing relevant articles, and the number of publications by research areas. Science mapping depicted clusters of co-occurring author keywords, their relationships, and the research themes' trend over two decades. Results: A total of 1483 publications were retrieved. The number of publications showed an upward trend, increasing from 61 before 2000 to 359 in 2020. The Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand was the leading journal, publishing 267 articles (18.0 %). Research areas were categorized into Basic Knowledge (n = 211), Clinical Problem Solving (n = 714), Health Service (n = 256), Health System (n = 254), and Medical Education (n = 48). Science mapping identified six clusters based on 106 co-occurrence keywords, including public health, health services, medical issues in older adults, healthcare access, epidemiology, and others. Research themes have shifted from infectious diseases and public health to primary care and non-communicable diseases. Conclusion: Future research should focus more on implementation at a population level and healthcare system, with more investigation into geriatric care and child and maternal health. © 2024

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP) is an evidence-based intervention approach that has significantly increased in popularity over the past two decades. However, how the research literature on this topic is patterned is still unknown, so it is difficult to identify potential areas for research and clinical interest. AIMS: To analyze the literature published on the CO-OP approach to provide a detailed and structured analysis of the publication patterns. DATA SOURCES: All literature related to CO-OP included in the Web of Science database through June 15, 2024. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA COLLECTION: All published studies related to CO-OP were included in the bibliometric analysis, which was conducted on the raw data retrieved from the Web of Science database using the Bibliometrix R package. FINDINGS: The annual growth rate in CO-OP research has been 0.8%, significantly increasing from 2015 onward. Most of the research has been published in occupational therapy and rehabilitation journals by English-speaking research teams, and its scope has expanded from developmental coordination disorder to a wide range of health conditions. In addition, two main lines of research have emerged: one focusing on understanding the underlying cognitive processes involved in CO-OP and the other focusing on its clinical effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Research on CO-OP has significantly increased over the past decade, and it currently encompasses a wide range of areas. This analysis may facilitate the advancement of research on and the clinical practical application of CO-OP. Plain-Language Summary: The Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP) is an evidence-based intervention approach that has significantly increased in popularity over the past two decades. Occupational therapists use it to improve the occupational performance of both children and adults with movement difficulties. However, it is unknown how the research literature on this topic is patterned, so it is difficult to identify potential areas for research and clinical interest. This study found that scientific literature on CO-OP has significantly increased in the past decade and that its scope has expanded from developmental coordination disorder to a wider range of health conditions, such as cerebral palsy. Moreover, research is now focused on two main questions: What are the underlying cognitive processes involved during intervention, and how effective is the CO-OP approach? These findings can be used to further improve occupational performance and participation among occupational therapy clients who struggle with motor performance and planning.

AB  - Monitoring training load can help improve performance, predict injury risk, determine athlete readiness, and keep track of health conditions. By using bibliometric analysis methods, one can evaluate publications from institutions or countries and track the growth or decline of a specific field. The purpose of this study is to compile a bibliography of works on the subject of training load monitoring that were published between 1979 and 2023. This study analyzes publications on training load monitoring and uses scientific mapping to describe the structure and trends. Contributions from countries, authors, cited articles, frequently appearing keywords, and keyword trends are all covered in this study. According to the findings, research was scarce during the first two decades and significantly increased in the next. While Australia has the most publications, the European continent dominates this research field. Most articles are published in and referenced from the International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance. Furthermore, due to its high citation count, Halson's article had the greatest influence. Some keywords are related and appear in this study. This article presents a trend visualization that academics can use as a reference guide. © Copyright: Federación Española de Asociaciones de Docentes de Educación Física (FEADEF)

AB  - Hurst's paper on the Nile's flow variability marked a pivotal moment in hydrology and beyond by introducing what was called the Hurst phenomenon. Independently, Kolmogorov developed a mathematical model describing this behaviour a decade earlier. The Hurst-Kolmogorov dynamics (HKd) is used to express this phenomenon physically and mathematically, which is characterised by high uncertainty and persistence (across spatial and temporal scales) and challenges traditional analytical frameworks, particularly in water resources-related topics and implications in engineering designs. Given the importance of HKd, a bibliometric analysis of it in water resources is helpful to trace its historical development, current state, and (possible) future trajectories. The latter intends to offer a comprehensive perspective on HKd, serving as a guide for new readers seeking an entry point into this field. Using the Web of Science database, 617 publications from 1974 to 2023 are analysed, revealing a consistent growth trend in research outputs up to 2018. Collaborative efforts among researchers worldwide have been prominent, with the USA and China leading in international collaborations. High-impact journals on topics related to water resources and geosciences are primary outlets for research related to the HKd. Interestingly, only two journals published the 20 most cited papers on this topic. A clear pattern from “groundwater” to “streamflow” to “soil moisture” to “precipitation” was observed from the past to the present. Overall, this analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the past, present, and future trends in HKd research, and highlights its contribution to the scientific literature of water resources. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ecotourism has the potential to uplift women's lives by relieving them from strenuous physical labour and improving their economic status. It also empowers them in cultural leadership roles and enhances their social standing while fostering gender equality. Therefore, bibliometric analysis has been used in the current study to quantitatively evaluate the interlinkage between ecotourism, gender roles, and women empowerment. From 2002 to 2022, 1026 research publications from the Scopus database have been analyzed using the popular bibliometric software VOSviewer. The published papers have been analyzed using bibliometric parameters (bibliographic, co-citation, co-authorship, and co-occurrence analyses). Based on the data, it is clear that studies examining the effects of ecotourism on women's empowerment and gender equality are rapidly becoming more prominent with the rising trend of annual publications as well as citations. The United Kingdom, the United States, China, Australia, and South Africa produce the most publications in this research. Gender equality and women empowerment as pertinent study issues are acquiring appropriate relevance in ecotourism owing to its in-depth and focused discussion of empowerment, participation, and entrepreneurship in achieving the fifth sustainable development goal (SDG). Our study shows that experts all around the globe are interested in the complex problems of gender stereotypes, traditional social norms, pull and push components of participation, and institutional challenges related to ecotourism and women's empowerment. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Big data has garnered substantial attention from urban researchers and policymakers, offering new perspectives for assessing the urban environment and supplementing traditional datasets. The increasing number of studies analyzing urban green space (UGS) topics using multiple sources of big data necessitates an in-depth review to guide future research. Existing reviews often narrow their focus to a single type of big data and offer limited coverage of UGS topics. In contrast, this review comprehensively synthesizes 445 UGS articles using three widely used types of big data, aiming to identify ongoing research trends and current gaps to inform future studies in this field. Based on bibliometric and thematic analyses, we identified five key topics: UGS assessment, human psycho-social responses to UGS, ecosystem services of UGS, UGS benefits, and UGS management tools. Research observations are summarized from a procedural perspective. Issues include the impacts of inherent big data limitations, challenges in using different data sources, and difficulties in explaining conclusions. Opportunities span from exploring new topics, developing methods to reduce biases, and applying advanced computational approaches. This review contributes to the current knowledge of UGS research using big data by synthesizing various types of big data, analyzing methodologies from new perspectives, and summarizing observations, issues and opportunities across multiple dimensions. It provides a reference for future UGS studies that apply big data. © 2024 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Objective: To understand the current status, research hotspots, and trends of automatic segmentation of fundus lesion images worldwide, providing a reference for subsequent related studies. Methods: The electronic database Web of Science Core Collection was searched for research in the field of automatic segmentation of fundus lesion images from 2007 to 2023. Visualization maps of countries, authors, institutions, journals, references, and keywords were generated and analyzed using the CiteSpace and VOSviewer software. Results: After deduplication, 707 publications were sorted out, showing an overall increasing trend in publication volume. The countries with the highest publication counts were China, followed by India, the USA, the UK, Spain, Pakistan, and Singapore. A high degree of collaboration was observed among authors, and they cooperated widely. The keywords included “diabetic retinopathy,” “deep learning,” “vessel segmentation,” “retinal images,” “optic disc localization,” and so forth, with keyword bursts starting in 2018 for “retinal images,” “machine learning,” “biomedical imaging,” “deep learning,” “convolutional neural networks,” and “transfer learning.” The most prolific author was U Rajendra Acharya from the University of Southern Queensland, and the journal with the most publications was Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine. Conclusions: Compared with manual segmentation of fundus lesion images, the use of deep learning models for segmentation is more efficient and accurate, which is crucial for patients with eye diseases. Although the number of related publications globally is relatively small, a growing trend is still witnessed, with broad connections between countries and authors, mainly concentrated in East Asia and Europe. Research institutions in this field are limited, and hence, the research on diabetic retinopathy and retinal vessel segmentation should be strengthened to promote the development of this area. © 2024

AB  - Analyses of stable isotopes (C, O, H) in tree rings are increasingly important cross-disciplinary programs. The rapid development in this field documented in an increasing number of publications requires a comprehensive review. This study includes a bibliometric analysis-based review to better understand research trends in tree ring stable isotope research. Overall, 1475 publications were selected from the Web of Science Core Collection for 1974–2023. The findings are that: (1) numbers of annual publications and citations increased since 1974. From 1974 to 1980, there were around two relevant publications per year. However, from 2020 to 2022, this rose sharply to 109 publications per year. Likewise, average article citations were less than four per year before 1990, but were around four per article per year after 2000; (2) the major subjects using tree ring stable isotopes include forestry, geosciences, and environmental sciences, contributing to 42.5% of the total during 1974–2023; (3) the top three most productive institutions are the Chinese Academy of Sciences (423), the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research (227), and the University of Arizona (204). These achievements result from strong collaborations; (4) review papers, for example, (Dawson et al., Annu Rev Ecol Syst 33:507–559, 2002) and (McCarroll and Loader, Quat Sci Rev 23:771–801, 2004), are among the most cited, with more than 1000 citations; (5) tree ring stable isotope studies mainly focus on climatology and ecology, with atmospheric CO2 one of the most popular topics. Since 2010, precipitation and drought have received increasing attention. Based on this analysis, the research stages, key findings, debated issues, limitations and directions for future research are summarized. This study serves as an important attempt to understand the progress on the use of stable isotopes in tree rings, providing scientific guidance for young researchers in this field. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Despite being a useful strategy for providing respiratory support to patients with advanced or terminal illnesses, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) requires in-depth investigation in several key aspects. Objectives: This bibliometric analysis seeks to comprehensively examine the existing research on the subject. Its goal is to uncover valuable insights that can inform the prediction trajectory of studies, guide the implementation of corrective measures, and contribute to the improvement of research networks. Methods: A comprehensive review of literature on NIV in the context of palliative care was conducted using the Web of Science core collection online database. The search utilized the key terms “non-invasive ventilation” and “palliative care” to identify the most relevant articles. All data were gathered on November 7, 2023. Relevant information from documents meeting the specified criteria was extracted, and Journal Citation Reports™ 2022 (Clarivate Analytics) served as the data source. The analysis employed literature analysis and knowledge visualization tools, specifically CiteScope (version 6.2.R4) and VOSviewer (version 1.6.20). Results: A dataset with bibliometric findings from 192 items was analyzed. We found a consistent upward of the scientific output trend over time. Guidelines on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis management received the highest number of citations. Most documents were published in top-ranked journals. Less than one-third of the documents pertain to clinical studies, especially retrospective analyses (25%). Key topics such as “decision making”, and “communication” were less addressed. Conclusions: Given the substantial clinical implications, further high-quality studies on this subject are recommended. Encouraging international collaborations is needed. Despite the growing volume of documents in the field, this bibliometric analysis indicates a decline in collaborative networks. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The objective of this research is to analyze the knowledge structure of the academic literature indexed in the Core Collection of the Web of Science (WoS) on gaining a competitive advantage through sustainability in the wine industry, from the first article registered in 2009 to 2023, in order to identify the latest trends in the topics under study. For this purpose, a bibliometric and systematic analysis of the literature was carried out. First, for the quantitative analysis of the scientific production, the bibliometric study was conducted, using the WoS database for data collection and the VosViewer and Bibliometrix applications to create the network maps. Second, once the bibliography had been examined quantitatively, the content analysis was performed following the PRISMA methodology. The results show, among other aspects, the uneven pace of growth of the scientific production studied since 2009, that innovation, wine tourism, carbon footprint, dynamic capabilities and climate change are among the current major topics of study, as well as the predominance of Italy, Spain, the United States and Australia in terms of scientific production in the subject matter. There are several justifications for the originality of this study, given that, first, it contributes to the understanding of the academic literature and the identification of the most recent trends in the field and, second, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there are no previous bibliometric studies that have addressed the topic analyzed. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Urban agriculture is acknowledged as a multifunctional integrated concept capable of delivering various ecosystem services. Design-related empirical research which is regarded as crucial for introducing and exploring the transformation of design knowledge and practice. Despite the growing body of scientific evidence, operational guidelines for this topic are relatively scarce. The primary step in promoting practical value involves reviewing existing design knowledge and transformation status in empirical research. In conjunction with the existing design research findings, research through design is the only way to acquire and test design knowledge. Spatial design is acknowledged as a way to translate theoretical concepts into practical applications. This systematic literature review offers a comprehensive qualitative analysis of urban agriculture, ecosystem services, and design research. Additionally, it utilizes bibliometric visualization tools to clarify existing research gaps and propose reliable solutions. This paper reveals the imbalance of design research in delivering ecosystem services in urban agriculture through the review of 70 selected empirical research articles. The results suggest that the research for design approach is the most prevalent and offers abundant design knowledge. However, the relatively infrequent use of the research through design method obstructs the transition from implicit to explicit design knowledge, resulting in a shortage of available operational guidelines. Consequently, the study proposes a framework for systematic design knowledge of urban agriculture to catalyze the transformation of design knowledge. Finally, we outline the framework's composition and logic and elucidate its role in addressing research gaps. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the research in sports management from a broader perspective, considering its scope, quality and impact. It uses bibliometric analysis, a method that quantifies and assesses academic studies, to reveal the trends, topics, methods and gaps in this field. Bibliometric analysis applies mathematical and statistical methods to analyse scientific activities and it can show the trends, hot topics, relationships and collaborations among countries, regions, institutions, research fields and authors by examining academic research conducted in various countries, universities and publications. The data for this study were collected from the Web of Science (WoS) database, which was chosen for the literature review because it is a more authoritative and widespread source than other databases and it offers high-quality journals and a complete data structure for bibliometric analysis. The search in the WoS database was conducted using keywords related to sports management, such as “sports economics, sports industry, financial sports, sports and economy, sports organization, sports management, sports media, sports technology, sports innovation, sports policy, sponsorship and sports clubs, sports business” and so on. The data were analysed with RStudio program and bibliometric analysis was performed. The results show that the number of studies in sports management has increased continuously from 1991 to 2023. Moreover, the contents of the studies in this field have changed over time. For instance, while the word «sport» was more common in the earlier years, the word «sports» has become more prevalent in recent years. This indicates that sport has evolved into a multidisciplinary concept that encompasses different sports branches. However, most of the studies in sports management do not adequately address the economic dimension of sports management. Therefore, there is a need for more and more comprehensive scientific publications in this field. The findings suggest that the research in this field is growing over time, but there are still many research gaps in sports economics. © Copyright: Federación Española de Asociaciones de Docentes de Educación Física (FEADEF)

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to highlight the moderating role of perceived organizational, supervisory and coworker’s support in weakening the negative relationship between fear of pandemic (FOP) and employee’s engagement in the Asian organizations. Furthermore, this study also aims to explore the role of employees’ engagement as an intervening mechanism, which mediates the relationship between FOP and employee’s performance in an Asian postpandemic context. Design/methodology/approach: Based on extensive review of recent literature and sound theoretical reasoning, the authors have developed a comprehensive conceptual framework (with related theoretical propositions) which provides clear guidelines as to how Asian Business Managers/organizations can minimize the adverse effect of the employee’s fear triggered by the pandemic at the workplace and how provision of effective and timely organizational/interpersonal support (i.e. organizational, managerial and coworkers level support) can help Asian Managers address various workplace challenges created by the pandemic moving forward. This study has further validated the proposed conceptual framework and related theoretical propositions by conducting an in-depth bibliometric analysis and by developing clusters of the co-occurrences based on most recent/ relevant literature published in the area. Findings: This study advances the knowledge in the areas of FOP and organizational support in particular. A comprehensive review of the literature clearly indicates how effective organizational, supervisory and peer support mechanism can help Asian Business Managers in alleviating the negative impact of the FOP on various employee level outcomes such as employees “engagement and performance” and how it can help Asian firms in addressing the associated challenges while working in a postpandemic context. Later on, an in-depth bibliometric analysis of the literature has revealed emerging knowledge patterns in the field and has indicated several key gaps in the existing literature which further confirms the theoretical framework and the propositions related thereto. Originality/value: Though several researchers have previously examined the fear created by COVID-19 at workplace, relatively fewer researchers have tried to link it up with employees’ level of involvement/ engagement at workplace. Even fewer researchers have tried to examine the vital role that organizational, managerial and peers support can play in minimizing the adverse effects created by pandemic-induced fears for employees’ productivity and performance in an Asian workplace context. Furthermore, hardly any efforts have been made to look at this popular notion of employees’ engagement as an intervening mechanism which carries a significant potential to mediate the relationship between FOP and employees’ job performance. This study aims to bridge all these gaps by integrating the two main streams of knowledge together, i.e. Four Horsemen of Fear and Organizational Support theory. Based on strong theoretical reasoning, an in-depth review and a bibliometric analysis of the relevant literature, the authors have developed a comprehensive conceptual framework which explains how various levels of support may interact with FOP to predict different levels of employees’ engagement in a contemporary Asian workplace and how this in turn may impact employees’ job performance while at work. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: Crohn's disease continues to be a major component of inflammatory bowel disease with increasing incidence and prevalence. Increasing publications of surgery in Crohn's disease have significantly expanded the research scope. The aim of this study is to characterize main topics and a full landscape of surgery in Crohn's disease. Methods: Studies of surgery in Crohn's disease from 2000 to 2020 were screened and retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), one of machine-learning algorithms for natural language processing, was employed for topic modeling. All the studies were processed, analyzed and visualized by R software, CiteSpace and Gephi. Results: A total of 3,697 original publications were identified from the database. USA was the leading country with the most top institutions such as Cleveland Clin Florida and Mayo Clinic and Mayo Foundation. Increasing impact of institutions from Korea and China was also noticed. Bo Shen was the leading author in publication. A machine learning based topic modeling identified major clusters, including disease assessment, surgical treatment and complications, risk factors and epidemiology, disease development and diagnosis, target treatment and recurrence. Three topics attracted continuous high research attention, including expression of intestinal cell, perianal fistula and laparoscopic and open operation. Conclusions: This study identified key topics relating to the development of surgery in Crohn's disease, and provided bibliometric insights and perspectives for future development in the field of surgery in Crohn's disease. © 2024 AME Publishing Company.

AB  - Research on the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has increased in recent years. However, a comprehensive analysis of the trends and hotspots in OCT research is currently lacking. The objective of this study was to identify global trends in research on OCT in ACS from a bibliometric perspective and to provide researchers with new research hotspots. Relevant literature from 1998 to 2023 was retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. CiteSpace and VOSviewer software were used to collect and analyze publication trends in related fields. A total of 965 publications from 58 countries and 1389 institutions were included in the present study. We found that Japan produced the most publications (20.83%, 201), followed by the United States (19.90%, 192), and China (14.09%, 136). However, the United States has the highest total number of citations in this field. Harvard Medical School and Harbin Medical University had the highest numbers of publications and citations. The journal with the most publications was the International Journal of Cardiology. Plaque erosion, calcified nodules, and intracoronary imaging are the most recent research hotspots and frontiers. Our work summarizes 25 years of OCT research in the ACS, highlighting hotspots, key themes, and emerging frontiers to help guide future research. Copyright © 2024 the Author(s).

AB  - This research aims to provide a foundation and overview of research in the field of CIR. This research provides a literature review of CIR research, especially the development and state of the art of CIR research over the past four decades. This research method uses systematic analysis based on bibliometric analysis. This research examines databases in Proquest and selected manuals of the last four decades. The results show that there is still an interesting debate regarding the determinants of CIR disclosure in each country. In addition, it illustrates how researchers in each country conducted the last four decades of CIR research. Therefore, the results of this study provide guidance and a literature review on future research—especially the impact of regulations and standards in each in the voluntary disclosure of CIR. In addition, corporate reporting regulators in each country can review the CIR disclosure policy, which is still voluntary. There has been no research that has created the state of the art of corporate internet reporting. © 2024, Malque Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - The rapid advancements in technology have opened up new doors for both teachers and students to explore, learn, and create in innovative ways. However, this progress has also brought forth new challenges and complexities that demand a deeper understanding of the use of technology in art education. In this context, bibliometric analysis has emerged as a potent tool to examine emerging trends in the intersection of technology and art education. Employing the PRISMA approach (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) and utilizing relevant Scopus databases with standardized procedures that ensure comprehensiveness and replicability, this bibliometric study identified 29 articles. The number of published articles in 2022, at 12, exceeded that of 2021, with only 6. Furthermore, the study highlighted the top 10 countries conducting research in technology and art education, with China having 17 studies, followed by the United States with 3 and Australia with 2. The top three keywords in current research trends are Education Computing, with 9 publications, E-learning, with 8, and Virtual Reality, with 7. Other keywords that relate to technology and art education are also pertinent to the research. These findings suggest that there is a growing interest in utilizing innovative research techniques to examine the intersection of technology and art education. As emerging technologies broaden the horizons of art-making and learning, they offer new avenues for creativity and innovation, but they also demand careful consideration of their potential benefits and risks. Educators and researchers will need to work in tandem to design effective strategies for integrating these technologies in ways that encourage creativity, learning, and social justice. © 2024, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

AB  - Women’s entrepreneurship plays a pivotal role in societal progress and economic development, fostering diversity, innovation, and inclusive growth. This review paper examines the significance of women entrepreneurship research through a multifaceted lens, encompassing surveys, questionnaires, and bibliometric analyses, spanning from 1985 to 2023. By utilizing the Scopus database and employing bibliometric analysis with VOSviewer, this study investigated trends, prominent authors, contributing institutions, and funding sources. While existing research has made progress, significant gaps remain, particularly in understanding cultural and socioeconomic contexts. By utilizing bibliometric analysis, this study identifies prominent authors, research areas, source institutions, nations, and funding sponsors contributing to the field. Moreover, it identifies emerging themes such as access to finance, post-COVID-19 entrepreneurship, rural and youth entrepreneurship, and human capital sustainability. By elucidating these factors, this research offers insights for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers to enhance support and promote women’s entrepreneurship globally. © 2024, Malque Publishing.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to present the results of a bibliometric analysis and literature review on the scientific production related to artificial intelligence (AI) applied to accounting and auditing, contained in the Scopus database between 2020 and 2023. The PRISMA model was used to identify the studies, due to its transparency in the process of obtaining relevant literature. For the first part, a descriptive and quantitative bibliometric analysis with keyword search in the Scopus database was used. For the second part, a subjective approach was followed based on a qualitative analysis based on the author’s interpretation. Both approaches were considered for their complementarity. The main quantitative characteristics of journals, authors, articles, conceptual structure, and social structure were identified. Also, the ethical implications of AI applied to accounting and auditing, and the way it impacts on accounting, tax auditing, financial strategy and decision making that contribute to the creation of value for their organization. Change the aversion to AI for adaptability and understanding that their auditing and forensic accounting were extracted. The accountant-auditor’s work will be increasingly computerized. They should focus more on analysis; professional profile must be transformed synergistically with AI. The study is intended to serve as a theoretical basis for future research. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The main objective of this paper is to analyze works of literature on SRI sukuk to highlight the potential for these kinds of instruments in financing more sustainable financial systems (SFSs). The analysis mainly accentuates a dearth of knowledge on the various challenges and opportunities in the realm of SRI. Design/methodology/approach: This paper pioneers the bibliometric and systematic literature review of the development of the SRI sukuk from 2016 (the first available year in the field) to and 2021. Findings: The study findings highlighted several pertinent SRI issues: the lack of standardization due to the different interpretations of Shariah and green, the lack of retail investors, which inevitably produce a lack of liquidity in the secondary market, thus limiting their growth, its funding allocation’ close resemblance to green financing, and the role of Malaysia and Indonesia as global sustainable financial hubs to stimulate the development of Shariah-compliant sustainable instruments and contribute to the international debate about the building of a global standardized framework related to sustainable investments. Originality/value: The integration of the environmental principles of a green bond with the Shariah-compliant financial structure of a sukuk, the SRI sukuk, represents a vital crossroad in both sustainable and Islamic finance. Social-impact sukuk and green sukuk is an undervalued instrument that could play an important role in financing a more sustainable economic and financial system, including Islamic investing. This kind of instruments, which is based on a “pay for success” principle in the conventional layout, perfectly fit with the profit-and-lost sharing’s (PLS's) ethicality, the sustainability principles of Islamic finance and the religious principles of Islamic law. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) significantly impacts young and middle-aged adults, with steroid use implicated in many cases. Traditional treatments have limited efficacy, prompting a shift towards innovative approaches, such as stem cell therapy, offering less invasive regenerative solutions. METHODS: Using bibliometric analysis from 1997 to 2023, we identified 392 articles on stem cell therapy for ONFH from the Web of Science Core Collection and analysed them using VOSviewer and CiteSpace to identify key trends and research directions. RESULTS: From 1997 to 2023, stem cell therapy for ONFH research expanded significantly, with 392 articles evidencing global collaboration, particularly from China, the United States and South Korea. The field is characterised by 158 core authors across 26 clusters and contributions from 417 institutions in 104 research clusters, with Shanghai Jiao Tong University as a notable leader. This research is disseminated through 23 journal clusters, emphasising interdisciplinary work, with Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research among the most influential journals. Key findings include the identification of the most influential papers, highlighting advances, such as use of autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and innovative delivery mechanisms. High-frequency keyword analysis further mapped the evolution of the field, from basic mechanisms to advanced therapies, underscoring a trend towards more targeted stem cell treatments for ONFH. CONCLUSION: Stem cell therapy for ONFH has advanced significantly, showcasing a successful transition from basic research to clinical practice, particularly highlighted by developments in use of autologous MSCs and delivery methods. Future research will focus on refining therapies through exosome technology, targeted modulation of stress and inflammation and integration with surgical techniques, with the aim of tailored patient care and improved ONFH outcomes. © 2024.

AB  - Planetary health is crucial to human well-being, ecosystem sustainability, and biodiversity preservation. In this context, camera traps are an effective remote sensing tool for monitoring biodiversity. Given the rising importance of understanding biodiversity patterns and trends, this study examines possible factors influencing camera-trap studies and provides bibliometric insights from 2377 publications indexed in the Web of Science (WoS). To explore the potential drivers of camera-trap research growth, we used a logistic model based on specific variables, including global gross domestic product, temperature growth, a planetary health measure the declining living planet index, and human population growth. The living planet index was identified as a statistically significant driver of camera-trap research growth (p-value <0.01), suggesting that curiosity regarding other living beings influences studies. Through the bibliometric analysis, we observed that camera-trap studies are predominantly conducted in the United States, followed by England and Australia, with a notable upward trend over recent years. These studies align with sustainable development goal 15 (Life on Land) and are primarily classified under the ecology category in WoS. Further, we have visualized the network of co-occurrence of authors and authors' affilation regions, keywords, and keywords plus documents. Overall, this study assesses ecological and conservation informatics and provides a reference to scholars, policymakers, and decision-makers. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - The COVID-19 epidemic has become a major international health emergency. Millions of people have died as a result of this phenomenon since it began. Has there been any successful pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 since the initial report on the virus? How many searches are undertaken to address the impact of the infection? What is the number of drugs that have undergone investigation? What are the mechanisms of action and adverse effects associated with the investigated pharmaceuticals used to treat COVID-19? Has the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved any medication to treat COVID-19? To date, our understanding is based on a restricted corpus of published investigations into the treatment of COVID-19. It is important to note that no single study comprehensively encompasses all pharmacological interventions for COVID-19. This paper provides an introductory summary of a bibliometric analysis conducted on the data about COVID-19, sourced explicitly from two platforms, namely PubMed and ScienceDirect. The analysis encompasses the period spanning from 2019 to 2022. Furthermore, this study examines the published literature about the pharmacological interventions for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), explicitly focusing on the safety and effectiveness of different medications such as Remdesivir (marketed as Veklury®), Lopinavir/Ritonavir (commercially known as Kaletra® or Aluvia®), Ribavirin, Favipiravir (marketed as Avigan®), Ivermectin, Casirivimab and Imdevimab (branded as Ronapreve®), Sotrovimab (marketed as Xevudy®), Anakinra, Molnupiravir, Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir (marketed as Paxlovid®), and Galidesivir. Findings indicate that while Remdesivir and Nirmatrelvir/Ritonavir show significant efficacy in reducing hospitalization and severe outcomes, drugs like Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Ivermectin have inconsistent results. Our insights suggest a multifaceted approach incorporating these therapies can significantly improve patient outcomes. Repurposing drugs has been critical in rapidly responding to COVID-19, allowing existing medications to be used in new ways to combat the virus. Combination therapies and further research are essential to optimize treatment strategies. © 2024

AB  - The NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a key component of the innate immune system that triggers inflammation and pyroptosis and contributes to the development of several diseases. Therefore, blocking the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has therapeutic potential for the treatment of these diseases. MCC950, a selective small molecule inhibitor, has emerged as a promising candidate for blocking NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Ongoing research is focused on elucidating the specific targets of MCC950 as well as assessfing its metabolism and safety profile. This review discusses the diseases that have been studied in relation to MCC950, with a focus on stroke, Alzheimer's disease, liver injury, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and sepsis, using bibliometric analysis. It then summarizes the potential pharmacological targets of MCC950 and discusses its toxicity. Furthermore, it traces the progression from preclinical to clinical research for the treatment of these diseases. Overall, this review provides a solid foundation for the clinical therapeutic potential of MCC950 and offers insights for future research and therapeutic approaches. © 2024 Deutsche Pharmazeutische Gesellschaft.

AB  - Badminton has become a sport that has grown rapidly in the last few decades. The goal of the study is to examine how badminton research has evolved over the past 30 years. The Bibliometric Analysis and Systematic Review method was applied in this study. A thorough approach was used to scan SCOPUS research journal databases for articles. The term "Badminton" was utilized. Furthermore, journals published within the last 30 years starting in 2023 were excluded from consideration. On October 17th, 2023, 1,053 items from Scopus were extracted. As a result, 217 articles were chosen for additional examination using the VOS viewer computer program. The study's findings demonstrated that over the past 20 years, there has been a notable increase in interest in badminton research. China, Spain, England, and Japan have contributed the most to this research. English dominates in scientific publications about badminton, although several other languages also contribute. Research subjects include athlete physiology, injuries, and health, as well as differences in playing styles and athlete rankings. Several studies have also highlighted the use of technology in-game analysis and athlete training. Research on badminton is an important part of the development of this sport and can support athletes' performance and health. In the next few decades, multidisciplinary research involving different languages and countries may be the key to a more comprehensive understanding of the sport of badminton. © Copyright: Federación Española de Asociaciones de Docentes de Educación Física (FEADEF)

AB  - Background: This paper aims to perform a bibliometric analysis of research pertaining to the nursing care of infected wounds. It also aims to examine the current focal points and trends in research development. The paper offers research references that may be useful for practitioners interested in related areas. Methods: The Web of Science Core Collection database was queried for publications pertaining to infected wound care. Publication trends and proportions were analyzed using Graphpad Prism v8.0.2. CiteSpace (6.2.4R [64-bit]) and VOSviewer (version 1.6.18) were employed to assess the literature and conduct mapping. Results: The Web of Science Core Collection database contains 3868 literature related to wound infection care, including 3327 articles and 541 reviews. The literature concerned 117 countries and territories, 4673 institutions, and 20,161 authors. The growth rate of literature was relatively slow before 2015 and markedly accelerated after 2016. Among them, the United States occupies the absolute dominance in research in this field, publishing 37.25% of the papers, and the United States occupies 8 of the top 10 scientific institutions that publish papers. The University of Harvard has published the largest number of papers. Keyword analysis shows a total of 1125 keywords, and through reference literature and time clustering analysis shows that wound healing, sepsis, spine surgery, postoperative infection, nanocrystalline silver, beta lactamase are the current research hotspots. Conclusion: The escalating rate of literary expansion since 2016 suggests that this domain is garnering an increasingly significant amount of interest. Minimizing the risk of patient wound infection is crucial in reducing patients' discomfort and facilitating their prompt recovery. The literature analysis presented in this study serves as a valuable resource for comprehending the current state of the subject and identifying the current areas of focus.

AB  - Literature reviews are an essential feature of academic research because, fundamentally, the advancement of knowledge must be built on prior existing work, and to push the frontiers of knowledge, one must be clear as to where these frontiers presently are. By systematically analyzing, synthesizing, and summarizing bodies of related literature, hypotheses can be tested and/or new theories and insights developed. However, despite the recent increase in systematic review research in business and management, and particularly marketing literature, arguably, many reviews continue to be poorly undertaken and reported due to a lack of a rigorous modus operandi for their journal editors, reviewers, and readers. The purpose of this paper is twofold, first to offer marketing researchers and practitioners a modus operandi to better demonstrate the optimization of rigor when undertaking quantitative systematic review research, and second to represent a call-to-action for marketing scholarship to engage further with optimizing rigorous systematic review research in the future. The paper thereby contributes to marketing literature by offering researchers and practitioners a three-stage protocol to demonstrate the optimization of rigor when undertaking systematic review research. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Background: Progress has been observed in the pathophysiology of calcium homeostasis, localization studies, and intraoperative adjuncts in parathyroid surgery. The aim of this study is to gain a comprehensive perspective on the research landscape of parathyroid surgery over time. Methods: A search of the Web of Science Core Collection was conducted to identify publications on parathyroid surgery from 1985 to 2024. Keywords were manually curated, and their frequencies were calculated based on the publication year. Results: Publications on secondary hyperparathyroidism have decreased in recent years, but those on calcimimetics, tertiary hyperparathyroidism, and parathyroid cancer have increased. Publications related to sestamibi scans have decreased, while research on four-dimensional computed tomography and positron emission tomography has increased. Research on fluorescence and ablation treatment has recently been on the rise. The citation count per publication was positively correlated with the number of contributing institutions. Conclusion: We provide an overview of contemporary research themes and emerging topics related to parathyroid surgery. The endocrine surgery community could benefit from more inter-institutional partnerships to foster scientific progress. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Packaging aims first to protect the quality and safety of food. Although synthetic packaging is easy and practical to use, it significantly poses many health and environmental hazards. In this context, the need for environmentally and food-friendly packaging is increasing. Edible coatings with many barrier properties cover the food surface like a blanket. This study evaluated content analyses and research trends on the edible coating of foods. For this goal, a bibliometric network analysis of the studies that included the concepts of “edible packaging”, “coating”, and “food” together in the abstracts, keywords, and titles of the articles was carried out. Today, with this network analysis method, it is easier to summarize innovations in edible coating technology and their applicability to foods in a detailed and understandable way. Between 2016 and 2023, bibliometric data consisting of 2131 studies were processed VOSviewer program using the network analysis method. Results revealed that China is the leading country in coatings studies, followed by India. The study shows which foods and methods the coatings are applied. © Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India) 2024.

AB  - The microscopic pore structure of coal is the main factor influencing the transport characteristics of coalbed methane (CBM). The systematic investigation of the control mechanism of the microscopic pore structure of coal on gas adsorption and desorption as well as seepage behavior is of great significance for the comprehensive understanding of the process of gas output and transport under the multi-scale of pore-fracture structure (PFS) in coal. In order to better grasp the current research dynamics and trends around the world, this paper adopts a bibliometric approach to review the progress of coal body pore-fracture research based on 6891 papers in the Web of Science Core Collection database and selects three clusters with more nodes in the keyword clusters as the starting point for analysis. The results show that: In terms of the number of publications on pore-fracture structure, it is characterized by two phases of slow growth (1998–2010) and rapid growth (2010–2022) with 2010 as the dividing line, and the rate of growth has been faster in recent years; in terms of the degree of international cooperation, China, the United States and Australia have a high degree of activity in this field of academic research and there are more international collaborations and exchanges. Pore structure characterization methods show a trend from semi-quantitative characterisation by fluid injection method to quantitative characterization by digital imaging, and from microscopic scale to very microscopic scale, and a combination of various characterization methods is required to realise the full-scale characterization of pore structure. The development of digital cores, pore network models (PNM) and molecular simulation (MS) has provided important technical means to investigate the micro-scale fluid storage and transport behavior of coal and has provided an important method to reveal the “black box” problem of coal reservoir pore structure. This paper reviews the latest progress and systematic summary of the research on the microporous structure of coal reservoirs, promotes the understanding of the microseepage mechanism of coalbed methane reservoirs, and puts forward an outlook on the future development of the multiscale characterization of the coal reservoir structure and the control mechanism of micro-gas transport based on the analysis of the current problems and challenges faced. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Retractions serve a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and accuracy of scientific literature. There has been growing interest in understanding the patterns behind retractions. This bibliometric study analyzed retracted articles published between 2003 and 2022, indexed by the Science Citation Index Expanded of the Web of Science Core Collection database. A total of 8466 retracted articles were identified, revealing an overall increase up to 2019, followed by a decline. A total of 109 countries contributed to the retracted articles, with China and the United States having the highest absolute numbers. In addition, the articles were published in 2347 different journals, with Tumor Biology recording the largest number of retracted articles. The top 10 most cited retracted articles indicated that data and image integrity issues were the main reasons for retraction. The primary reasons for retractions, identified by linking the retracted articles to the Retraction Watch Database, were data and results issues followed by plagiarism and duplication. In conclusion, the present bibliometric study offered an overview of the status of retracted articles indexed by the Web of Science Core Collection over the past two decades. These findings provide insight into areas where scientific integrity may be compromised and serve as a guide to foster a responsible research environment. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Drilling fluids play a pivotal role in well construction, serving as the key components that maintain the structural integrity of the well during drilling. The management of these fluids has seen swift advancements in technology recently, allowing for enhanced planning of well construction. These advancements have led to drilling fluids with improved properties, which greatly affect the efficiency and total cost of drilling activities. They are employed in drilling operations to cool and lubricate the drill bit, control formation pressure, transport cuttings to the surface, and fortify the stability of the wellbore. Recognizing their significance in the petroleum industry, the authors have conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis on drilling fluids. A thorough screening yielded 9,535 pertinent studies from Scopus over the past twenty years. Tools such as Office 365 VOS viewer and RStudio were used to analyse the metadata of these studies. The findings indicate a marked increase in drilling fluid research over this period. This study particularly identifies 150 noteworthy collaborations between China and the United States of America. These collaborations are probably a result of their respective large-scale oil and gas operations, sophisticated research facilities, and mutual dedication to the growth of petroleum industry technology. In addition, a comprehensive evaluation of the top 32 cited articles produced between 2018 and 2024 has been conducted, and their significance in the area has been rigorously examined and evaluated. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a vital pro-inflammatory cytokine crucial for immune regulation. Despite its significance, bibliometric analysis in this field is lacking. This study aims to quantitatively and qualitatively assess IL-18 research to construct its intellectual base and predict future hotspots. We conducted a thorough search on the Web of Science Core Collection for relevant publications between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2022. English-language articles and reviews were included. Visual analysis was performed using various tools including VOSviewer, Citespace, and Microsoft Excel. Our analysis covers interleukin-18 (IL-18) literature from 2012 to 2022, exploring research trends comprehensively. Key institutions like Yale University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University emerged as significant contributors. Prolific authors such as Kanneganti and Dinarello made notable contributions. Main focus areas included biology, medicine, and immunology. Co-citation analysis highlighted influential works like Jianjin Shi. Hotspot keyword frequency cluster analysis revealed emerging themes like pyroptosis and psoriasis. Gene co-occurrence clustering identified genes associated with immune regulation and inflammation. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis provided insights into IL-18-related biological processes and pathways. Protein–protein interaction networks identified core proteins such as IL10 and TNF. Association disease analysis linked IL-18 to various inflammatory, autoimmune, and metabolic disorders. This bibliometric review offers insights into IL-18 research trends over the past decade, guiding future investigations and serving as a reference for researchers in this field. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - The use of social media in crisis informatics has become increasingly popular across a range of disciplines. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques enables the analysis of textual data in novel ways and facilitates the use of social media data in disaster management. Analyzing text from social media with NLP can enhance situational awareness, accelerate information dissemination, and monitor affected communities, which is crucial for government agencies and emergency decision makers. However, a comprehensive literature review of NLP and social media data in disaster management is lacking, which presents an obstacle to rapid development in this field. To address this gap, this project surveys 324 related articles published between 2011 and 2022 and investigates the current trends and state-of-the-art NLP applications for using social media data in managing natural disasters. The bibliometric analysis reveals that existing literature focused more on earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes, concentrating on during-event periods, with Twitter (now referred to as X) as the most cited information source. Moreover, our systematic analysis identifies common NLP methodologies and identifies five major applications in current research. Finally, this study provides important insights and potential directions for future research in social media, NLP, and disaster management. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Background: Orexin is an excitatory neuropeptide produced in the lateral hypothalamus, playing a role in various physiological functions in humans. There is a growing body of literature on orexins. This paper utilizes CiteSpace software to organize and analyze a significant number of articles on orexin, providing readers with an intuitive overview of research trends and emerging hot topics in this field. Methods: The electronic database, Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), was searched for publications related to orexins. Annual publications, countries/regions, institutions, authors and keywords were analyzed, and the results were visualized via CiteSpace software. Results: A total of 5486 publications were included, with articles making up 85.30% and reviews 14.70%. The top 3 countries publishing the most papers on orexins were the United States (2057 papers), Japan (778), and China (556). The leading institutions included Research Libraries UK (278), Harvard University (250), and Stanford University (221). The most prolific authors in the field were Yves Dauvilliers (69), Abbas Haghparast (67), and Takeshi Sakurai (66). The most frequently used keywords were "neurons"(981), followed by "sleep"(824), "food intake"(612), "receptors"(547), and "neuropathology"(535). Recent research hotspots include melanin-concentrating hormone neurons, Alzheimer disease, gamma-aminobutyric acid neurons, oxidative stress, suvorexant, the orexin system, prevalence, and stress. Based on keyword clustering analysis, the top 5 research hotspots from 2003 to 2022 were: the effects of orexins on sleep and metabolism, potential pathways of orexin signaling, the relationship between orexin and immunity, new findings on depression and hypertension related to orexin, and possible targets for neurodegenerative diseases. Conclusion: Orexin, a neuropeptide linked to various physiological and pathological processes, plays a crucial role in sleep/wakefulness, reward mechanisms, stress responses, and neurodegenerative diseases. Its significant research value and potential medical applications are underscored by the rapid expansion of studies, particularly in the USA and Japan. However, the lack of collaboration among researchers highlights the need for enhanced academic exchange and cooperation to further advance the field of orexin research.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to investigate the performance analysis, science mapping and future direction of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, applications, tools and software used to preserve, curate and predict the historical value of cultural heritage. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the bibliometric research method and utilizes the Scopus database to gather data. The keywords used are “artificial intelligence” and “cultural heritage,” resulting in 718 data sets spanning from 2001 to 2023. The data is restricted to the years 2001−2023, is in English language and encompasses all types of documents, including conference papers, articles, book chapters, lecture notes, reviews and editorials. Findings: The performance analysis of research on the use of AI to aid in the preservation of cultural heritage has been ongoing since 2001, and research in this area continues to grow. The countries contributing to this research include Italy, China, Greece, Spain and the UK, with Italy being the most prolific in terms of authored works. The research primarily falls under the disciplines of computer science, mathematics, engineering, social sciences and arts and humanities, respectively. Document types mainly consist of articles and proceedings. In the science mapping process, five clusters have been identified. These clusters are labeled according to the contributions of AI tools, software, apps and technology to cultural heritage preservation. The clusters include “conservation assessment,” “exhibition and visualization,” “software solutions,” “virtual exhibition” and “metadata and database.” The future direction of research lies in extended reality, which integrates virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR); virtual restoration and preservation; 3D printing; as well as the utilization of robotics, drones and the Internet of Things (IoT) for mapping, conserving and monitoring historical sites and cultural heritage sites. Practical implications: The cultural heritage institution can use this result as a source to develop AI-based strategic planning for curating, preservation, preventing and presenting cultural heritages. Researchers and academicians will get insight and deeper understanding on the research trend and use the interdisciplinary of AI and cultural heritage for expanding collaboration. Social implications: This study will help to reveal the trend and evolution of AI and cultural heritage. The finding also will fill the knowledge gap on the research on AI and cultural heritage. Originality/value: Some similar bibliometric studies have been conducted; however, there are still limited studies on contribution of AI to preserve cultural heritage in wider view. The value of this study is the cluster in which AI is used to preserve, curate, present and assess cultural heritages. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - A significant number of Maritime Bibliometric Studies (MBSs) have been published over the past years. The present research aims to evaluate a large amount of the relevant literature to characterize Maritime Industry Areas (MIAs). A bibliometric analysis of MBSs is conducted to evaluate important MBSs. The performed analysis examines the main features of each MBS, relationships between them, and their impact on the development of MIAs. A unique approach is developed based on a bibliometric methodology to study previously published MBSs through the performance analysis, trend analysis, statistical analysis, bibliographic coupling analysis, word clouds analysis, and conceptual thematic map analysis. To provide a high level of accuracy and reliability of mapping and analysis, various bibliometric software tools are used. The visibility and readability of the obtained results aim to establish the new pathways for bibliometric studies that could be easily applied to a broad spectrum of research areas. The outcomes of the conducted analysis confirm that MBSs present very accumulative research paths in MIAs with a continuous change in dynamics that well characterize this research domain and highlight the conceptual structure of MIAs. The findings showcase journal and publication trends, identified research topics and sub-topics, the main study attributes, and the most influential MBSs with the highest scholarly impact. Some interesting future research directions that can be explored for MBSs in the following years are comprehensively described. Last but not least, the important role of bibliometric methods for evaluation of the existing and future studies related to MIA applications is discussed in detail as well. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Genetic factors play a significant role in the development of congenital heart disease (CHD). Many studies on the genetics of CHD have been published worldwide; however, no research has assessed and mapped the global research landscape of these studies. This bibliometric and visualized study aimed to delineate research hotspots and trends in the field of CHD genetics. Scientific papers on the genetics of CHD from January 1, 1950, to December 31, 2023, were obtained by searching the Web of Science Core Collection. The bibliometric metadata of each chosen research paper were extracted, analyzed, and visualized using tools such as Microsoft Excel 2021, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace. The final analysis included 5317 papers discussing the genetics of CHD. The countries and journals that published the highest number of papers were the United States (n=2118), and American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A (n=332), respectively. In addition to CHD and genetics, keywords such as tetralogy of Fallot, ventricular septal defect, and atrial septal defect appeared most frequently among 8365 keywords. Eight clusters were formed to categorize the keywords. Keywords such as case-control study, whole genome sequencing, and whole exome sequencing in clusters 6, 7, and 8, respectively, had the latest average publication year among all clusters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first bibliometric analysis of CHD genetics studies. Tetralogy of Fallot, ventricular septal defect, and atrial septal defect are global research topics. The interactions between environmental and genetic factors in the pathogenesis of CHD, genetic etiology of CHD-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension, and molecular genetics of CHD via high-throughput genomic technology are possible areas of future research on the genetics of CHD.

AB  - Purpose: The paper aims to carry out a comprehensive literature mapping to synthesise and descriptively analyse the research trends of biodiversity accounting, providing implications for managers and policymakers, whilst also outlining a future agenda for scholars. Design/methodology/approach: A bibliometric analysis is carried out by adopting the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses protocol for searching and selecting the scientific contributions to be analysed. Citation analysis is used to map a current research front and a bibliographic coupling is conducted to detect the connection networks in current literature. Findings: Biodiversity accounting is articulated in five thematic clusters (sub-areas), such as “Natural resource management”, “Biodiversity economic evaluation”, “Natural capital accounting”, “Biodiversity accountability” and “Biodiversity disclosure and reporting”. Critical insights emerge from the content analysis of these sub-areas. Practical implications: The analysis of the thematic evolution of the biodiversity accounting literature provides useful insights to inform both practice and research and infer implications for managers, policymakers and scholars by outlining three main areas of intervention, i.e. adjusting evaluation tools, integrating ecological knowledge and establishing corporate social legitimacy. Social implications: Currently, the level of biodiversity reporting is pitifully low. Therefore, organisations should properly manage biodiversity by integrating diverse and sometimes competing forms of knowledge for the stable and resilient flow of ecosystem services for future generations. Originality/value: This paper not only updates and enriches the current state of the art but also identifies five thematic areas of the biodiversity accounting literature for theoretical and practical considerations. © 2023, Gennaro Maione, Corrado Cuccurullo and Aurelio Tommasetti.

AB  - Background: The intricate interplay between inflammation and lung cancer has long been recognized by large number of studies, yet a comprehensive understanding of this relationship remains elusive. There is a clinical need to elucidate the role of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in lung cancer, particularly their impact on prognosis and therapy. This study aims to address these gaps by conducting a bibliometric analysis to explore the correlations between lung cancer, inflammation, and TLS, highlighting collaborative networks, publication trends, and emerging research directions. Methods: This study conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of academic literature on lung cancer and inflammation from 2013 to 2023 using the Web of Science Core Collection database. The search strategy "topic (TS) = ('lung cancer') AND TS = (inflammation)" yielded 5,470 records, which were refined through exclusion criteria to 1,284 relevant studies. The inclusion process involved excluding non-English studies and non-original articles or reviews, followed by a relevance check based on titles and abstracts. The bibliometric indicators were calculated based on a transparent and repeatable methodology to ensure the integrity of the findings. Results: The investigation encompassed 1,284 selected studies, revealing an escalating publication trend since 2013. The interdisciplinary scope of research is apparent, with contributions from 54 countries, with China at the forefront. In-depth author and journal analyses exposed key contributors like Zhang L and influential journals like "Lung Cancer". Co-citation networks illuminated crucial references, clusters, and evolving themes over time, underscoring the intricate relationship between inflammation, cancer, and TLS. TLS as a key component of immune response and inflammation, studying its mechanism of impact on cancer will be a potential research direction in the future. Conclusions: This study underscores the pivotal role of inflammation in lung cancer progression, mediated by a delicate balance of immune responses. The emerging prominence of TLS as indicator of adaptive immune responses within the tumor microenvironment (TME) offers intriguing avenues for future research and therapeutic interventions. However, limitations in the current research, such as the need for more longitudinal studies and clinical trials, must be addressed. The insights gained from this bibliometric analysis can inform clinical practices and guide future investigations into novel strategies to improve patient outcomes. © 2024 AME Publishing Company.

AB  - Numerous studies have delved into the application of augmented reality (AR) in chemistry education, focusing on specific topics, equipment requirements, and advantages. However, there remains a notable dearth of research examining the evolutionary characteristics of AR in this context. This study, employing bibliometric analysis on 66 articles spanning from 2012 to 2022, reveals that research primarily revolves around pedagogical approaches and AR technology development, particularly in kindergarten to 12th grade (K-12) education. Despite the United States exhibiting the highest publication frequency, there is a significant absence of studies addressing emotions, cognition, and physiological changes. Shedding light on these research gaps, this study underscores the need for further exploration into the cognitive, emotional, and physiological aspects of AR integration in chemistry education. Ultimately, the insights gleaned from this study offer valuable guidance for researchers, educators, and practitioners alike, facilitating the advancement and effective application of augmented reality in chemistry education (ARCE). © 2024, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

AB  - Background: β-Lactams remain the most reported drug allergy globally, with the volume and diversity of related drug allergy research continuing to accumulate. Recognizing evolving research trends can help inform future directions and encourage synergistic collaborations. Objective: We conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of all publications relevant to β-lactam allergy, with a focus on longitudinal publication rates, international collaborations, and key word/trend analysis. Methods: Meta-data from all original articles, letters, and reviews relevant to β-lactam allergy on the Web of Science Core Collection up until December 31, 2023, were analyzed. Results: From 1966 to 2023, there were 4451 records (3536 articles, 631 reviews, and 284 letters) from 78 countries. There was an exponential increase in publications, especially during the past decade, with half of all publications on β-lactam allergy published during this time (50.6% [2252 of 4452]). Overall, 18.1% of the publications (805 of 4452) involved international coauthorships, with a significant increase since the previous decade (12.7% vs 23.3% [P < .001]). The most frequent key words in the first published half of articles were skin testing (84 of 1919), IgE (57 of 1919), and anaphylaxis (49 of 1919); in contrast to the key word skin testing (137 of 3351), the key words drug provocation test (121 of 3351), antimicrobial resistance (120 of 3351), and antimicrobial stewardship (118 of 3351) were the most frequent key words in the latter half. Conclusion: There has been a surge in publications, international collaboration, and shifting paradigms in β-lactam allergy research. The field has evolved beyond focusing on in vitro tests or desensitization toward antimicrobial stewardship. However, there still seems to be relatively fewer collaborations with non-Western countries. Further international collaborations to harmonize delabeling strategies against the threat of mislabeled β-lactam allergy should be encouraged. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Purpose: This study conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) on social inclusion within upstream supply chains, targeting a notable literature gap in modern SCM discourse. By delving into this critical, yet underexamined, domain, this study spotlights the pressing need to incorporate social inclusion practices, particularly as global supply chains face increased scrutiny over their social ramifications. It examines social inclusion’s intricacies, offering practical insights for industry professionals to adopt, so that trustworthy social inclusion practices can proliferate across their upstream supply chains, thereby making a substantial contribution to both theoretical understanding and practical application. Design/methodology/approach: Employing five search queries across two leading academic databases, this investigation reviewed 86 articles that examined social issues related to social inclusion in the upstream supply chain. Via content analysis, this study aims to answer essential research questions and employs statistical bibliometric analyses to investigate the collected data further. Findings: This study’s findings establish a definition of social inclusion within the upstream supply chain and present a conceptual framework delineating levers and indicators for evaluating such practices. Through rigorous analysis, it becomes apparent that mechanisms such as supplier compliance, collaboration and development are crucial for promoting social inclusion; however, their importance differs at various levels of suppliers in multi-tiered supply chains. Furthermore, a methodological matrix is introduced for assessing social inclusion practices’ efficacy, equipping practitioners with a roadmap for developing and executing strategies that extend social inclusion efforts throughout the supply chain, as well as emphasising these levers through monitoring, assessment and application of six specified indicators. Originality/value: This study contributes to the dialogue surrounding upstream supply chain management by spotlighting social inclusion practices, addressing the literature gap in comprehending how social inclusion dynamics operate within upstream supply chains and outlining a distinct direction for forthcoming research. By highlighting the pressing importance of enhancing social inclusion practices, this study not only enriches the theoretical landscape but also lays the groundwork for subsequent empirical studies aimed at deciphering the complexities and practical hurdles associated with the efficient execution of these practices. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Introduction: High-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) devices are used to improve airway clearance in various respiratory conditions. This study comprehensively assesses the evidence on efficacy and safety and identifies trends in scientific publications and patents across geographic regions. Methods: This study utilized an integrated approach, combining bibliographic and bibliometric research with artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Four databases – PubMed, Europe Pubmed Central, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and CINAHL – were searched for systematic reviews on the effectiveness of treatment options for HFCWO. The AMSTAR-2 tool was used to evaluate the risk of bias in systematic reviews. Bibliographic research synthesized the evidence following PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines. The Dimensions platform was used for bibliometric analysis to provide insights into the global landscape. AI tools with prompt engineering tools Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT) were used to enhance data extraction capabilities. Results: The umbrella review identified 12 systematic reviews supporting the effectiveness of HFCWO in improving pulmonary function parameters, sputum characteristics, dyspnea, health scores, and quality of life in conditions including cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or neuromuscular diseases, with varying evidence of certainty. Eight of the twelve reviews had a moderate to high AMSTAR-2 confidence level, while several studies lacked sufficient descriptions of methods, treatment regimens, outcome measures, and adverse effects. Despite the absence of adverse events, the overall evidence quality between studies is evaluated as low to very low. Bibliometric analysis found a significant increase in global interest over the past two decades, with 230 research publications, 137 patents, and 56 clinical trials. Conclusions: The study highlights the potential of HFCWO devices in respiratory care but demands more robust evidence. The increasing interest in airway clearance devices highlights the necessity for HFCWO mechanism and safety research, underlining its therapeutic relevance in respiratory medicine. The interdisciplinary integration of AI tools and prompt engineering contributes to a nuanced understanding of the available evidence. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background Abdominal wall reconstruction (AWR) is a treatment option for structural defects of the abdominal wall. The most frequently cited publications related to AWR have not been quantitatively or qualitatively assessed. This bibliometric analysis characterizes and assesses the most frequently cited AWR publications, to identify trends, gaps, and guide future efforts for the international research community. Methods The 100 most cited publications in AWR were identified on Web of Science, across all available journal years (from May 1964 to December 2023). Study details, including the citation count, main content focus, and outcome measures, were extracted and tabulated from each publication. Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine levels of evidence (LOE) of each study were also assessed. Results The 100 most cited publications in AWR were cited by a total of 9674 publications. Citations per publication ranged from 43 to 414 (mean 96.7 ± 52.48). Most publications were LOE 3 (n = 60), representative of the large number of retrospective cohort studies. The number of publications for LOE 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 was 21, 2, 60, 2, and 12, respectively. The main content focus was surgical technique in 44 publications followed by outcomes in 38 publications. Patient-reported outcome measures were used in 3 publications, and no publications reported validated esthetic outcome measures. Conclusions Overall, 3 was the LOE for most frequently cited AWR publications, with more publications below LOE 3 than above LOE 3. Validated outcome measures and patient-reported outcome measures were infrequently incorporated in the studies evaluated. © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Statement of problem: Implant-retained overdentures are a recognized treatment option. However, a comprehensive assessment of all articles on implant-retained overdentures to identify publication standards such as mean citation and the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) impact factor is lacking. Purpose: The purpose of this bibliometric assessment was to evaluate the association of mean citation and JCR impact factor with bibliometric parameters in articles on implant-retained overdentures. Material and methods: Articles reporting randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized controlled clinical trials (N-RCTs); case reports and series; retrospective studies; and in silico, in vitro, or systematic reviews in 6 databases were included. Data were extracted, and 2 multiple Poisson regressions analyses were applied (α=.05). The dependent variables were mean citation and JCR impact factor, which were evaluated to identify their association with bibliometric parameters by using prevalence ratio (PR) values. Results: A total of 1369 articles published from 1986 to 2021 were included. The data revealed a high mean citation and high JCR impact factor for RCT, N-RCT, retrospective, and in vitro studies (P<.05). In silico studies presented a high mean citation (P<.001). Senior researchers with a high h-index were more likely to have a high mean citation and publications with a high JCR impact factor (P<.001). Also, senior authors associated with an international network were more likely to have a high mean citation (P=.001). High-income countries had more studies with a high mean citation and JCR impact factor (P<.05). Higher JCR impact factors were associated with articles evaluating only the maxilla or mandible (P<.05). The topics “implant setting” and “macrodesign” were associated with a high mean citation (P<.05). Conclusions: The publication trends suggest a high mean citation and a high JCR impact factor for clinical designs (RCT, N-RCT, retrospective) and in vitro studies. The same pattern was also displayed for researchers with a high h-index and located in high-income countries. © 2022 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry

AB  - Objectives: This article aims to analyze the scientific literature on hearing loss (HL) in the field of Otorhinolaryngology published from the past to the present. Methods: A comprehensive dataset comprising 8013 articles on HL, spanning from 1980 to 2023, was retrieved from the Web of Science database and analyzed using various statistical and bibliometric methods. Results: The leading countries in productivity were the United States, Japan, and Germany. The top productive journals included the International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology (n = 652), Otology & Neurotology (579), and Acta Oto-Laryngologica (512). The journals with the highest h-index on hearing loss were Hearing Research (h = 65), Ear and Hearing (60), and Laryngoscope (55). Factor analysis revealed that the HL literature consisted of four constructs: main topics, speech/sound, genetics, and pharmaceutical therapies. Sudden sensorineural HL, sensorineural HL, cochlear implant, unilateral, noise-induced and conductive HL, pediatric and age-related HL, tinnitus, auditory brainstem response, audiometry, and prognoses for hearing health were the most researched topics from past to present. In recent years, the trending topics are genomic analysis, gene mutations, whole-exome sequencing, genetic sequencing technique, the use of machine learning in HL, and the effect of COVID-19 on hearing health. Conclusion: The bibliometric analysis results clearly indicate significant progress in the field of hearing loss over the past 40 years. The 8013 articles published between 1980 and 2023 encompass a wide range of research in this area. These analyses can assist in identifying priority areas and focal points for future research.

AB  - The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) emphasize promoting and protecting women's rights and privileges. As a result, an increasing body of academic literature describes the various actions taken by different stakeholders to empower women. Amongst the initiatives implemented in many nations, microfinance and financial inclusion programs play a major role. This article aims to present an overview and synthesis of the research on the notion and practices of microfinance and its influence on entrepreneur women's empowerment. In order to do so, this study uses bibliometric techniques over a selection of papers extracted from the Web of Science database, to disentangle the knowledge structure of this academic field. According to our findings, the study of microfinance and women's empowerment is growing, with 470 publications, 963 authors, 67 nations and 36 research areas. Research topics include poverty reduction, gender issues in entrepreneurship, microfinance and women empowerment, and women in microcredit. An additional bibliographic coupling analysis has revealed the hottest research topics, showing the main gaps in the literature that suggest potential directions for future research. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Background: Tai chi has been used to treat different forms of osteoporosis and increase bone density without the use of pharmaceuticals. Objective: The purpose of this study was to use bibliometric analysis to methodically examine trends and hotspots of tai chi treatment for osteoporosis in order to generate references for further investigation. Methods: The articles on Tai Chi to treat osteoporosis was obtained from China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Fang, Web of Science (WOS) and PubMed between inception and November 8,2023. The annual publication volume, authors, institutions, and keywords, along with co-citation, clustering, and burst analysis, were analyzed using CiteSpace. Results: Totally, 328 publications were included. The number of annual publications has been rising rapidly in recent years. Beijing University of Chinese Medicine and Shanghai University of Sport are two of the best universities for Tai Chi treatment in osteoporosis. This area of research is dominated by Zhou, Y; Yu, DH; Pence, BC and Qin,L. Core authors and core institutions having a relatively low level of collaboration indicates that there may be limited interaction and cooperation between these key players in the field. China had the highest volume of publications, followed by the United States. Furthermore, the majority of the study subjects and influence mechanism are the focus of current research in this field. Conclusion: Tai Chi in osteoporosis research field is in a stage of stable development. Universities and higher education institutions are the leading institutions in this field. China and the United States emerging as high productivity nations. The study of Tai Chi in osteoporosis not only focuses on the applicable population, effects and intervention methods, but also gradually shifts to the mechanism study such as “secretion of beneficial factors”, “physical exercise load” and “oxidative stress status”. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - In recent years, the frequent occurrence of green tides has attracted attention from academia and industry. Despite some literature reviews, systematic bibliometric and visualization analyses are still lacking. The study employs CiteSpace and VOSviewer tools to conduct a bibliometric and visualization analysis of green tide-related literature from the Web of Science (1995 to 2023). The study identifies key countries, institutions, journals, disciplines, and authors, and maps out their collaborative networks. Co-citation analysis provides an initial overview of various aspects within the green tide field. Keyword analysis has reveals six core themes: remote sensing applications, eutrophication and green tides, phylogenetic analysis, the impact of climate change, green tide management and applications, and studies focused on green tides in the China Sea. Additionally, keyword burst analysis has revealed two emerging trends. This study provides a strategic framework for future research, serving as a navigational guide in the field of green tide studies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to clarify the impact mechanisms and weighting factors of environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices on corporate value through bibliometric analysis and core interpretation of existing literature, further explore whether and under what conditions ESG practices contribute to the corporate value creation, and provide an outlook on future research directions. Design/methodology/approach: Bibliometric method is used to analyze literature co-citation, burst detection and keyword co-occurrence, and literature review method is used to condense important ideas from the existing literature. Findings: Through the review, analysis and summary of the existing literature, this paper finds that the perspectives of risk, information and strategy reflect the key pathways through which ESG practices play a role in avoiding harm and creating value for companies directly or indirectly. Macro, meso and micro factors moderate the direction and extent of the impact. Moreover, considering the relationship between ESG performance and ESG disclosure is key to understanding some contradictory findings. Research limitations/implications: The search terms limit the articles considered, and therefore, the research framework may be incomplete. Moreover, this article is primarily aimed at the research field and lacks guidance at the practical level. Practical implications: This paper helps the academic community to deepen its understanding of ESG, moving beyond the question of whether ESG is linked to corporate value to further understand why and under what conditions ESG practices create value for firms. Social implications: This paper has great practical significance in motivating companies to actively participate in ESG practices. Originality/value: The theoretical framework in this paper reveals the black box between enterprise ESG practices and value creation, and clarifies the research boundary of “the relationship between ESG practices and value creation,” contributing to the future research in this field. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study is a critical review to assess the feasibility of using magnetic water to boost the overall performance of concrete. This is specifically conducted by evaluating the improvements of mechanical properties (split tensile strength, compressive strength, and flexural strength), cement particle water absorption, and cement hydration of concrete as a result of adding magnetic water if compared to concrete made with regular tap water. The benefits and associated challenges of utilising magnetic water in concrete are thoroughly discussed based on the most recent experimental and numerical studies published in the open literature between 2019 and 2023. According to the findings, the tensile strength, compressive strength, flexural strength, and electrical conductivity increase by 6.1%, 24.4%, 3.9%, and 0.5%, respectively, in concretes created with MW compared to regular tap water. Also, the magnetic field intensity of 1.3 Tesla yields the greatest improvement in the slump by 5–13 mm. However, the magnetic water shows the highest sorptivity at a magnetic field intensity of 0.9 Tesla. Also, using magnetic water makes concrete block pavers less absorbent of water and more resistant to assault by sulfuric acid. This review would encourage future research and widespread use of magnetic water in concrete production. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This article examines the state of research on sport entrepreneurship, with a particular focus on the intersection of entrepreneurship, innovation, and creativity in sport management. Sport is an increasingly important sector of the global economy, yet little attention has been given to the role of entrepreneurship in its development. This article argues that entrepreneurship, innovation, and creativity are crucial drivers of change, innovation, and employment in sport and that sport entrepreneurship is an emerging but unorganized stream of business research. To better understand the relationship between these research fields, we performed a study that combined a systematic review and a bibliometric analysis. This article presents thematic shifts in the field of sport entrepreneurship, innovation, and creativity. It proposes an integrated model of sport entrepreneurship, offering novel perspectives that contribute to the field. Furthermore, the article addresses the lack of research on creativity, sustainability, and the sport entrepreneur, charting underexplored territories. Overall, this article provides a comprehensive overview of current research on sport entrepreneurship and identifies key areas for future investigation. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Public space is increasingly provided and managed by a variety of actors. In order to describe this phenomenon, several concepts have been used, such as co-production, co-creation and co-design. This paper reviews the existing literature on public space and reveals that these concepts are defined similarly and used interchangeably. Based on a systematic literature review, and aided by bibliometric analysis, the paper attempts to establish transparency regarding current understanding and use of the concepts. By discussing the differences, the paper aims to reduce the ambiguity and increase the clarity of the concepts. The paper concludes by suggesting in which case it would be more appropriate to use which concept. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Water pollution with fluoride can cause dental fluorosis, skeletal deformities, and other diseases, posing serious harm to human health. To understand the development status, research hotspots, and frontier trends in fluoride-containing wastewater (FCW) treatment, this study employed bibliometric methods to visually analyze 2840 publications related to FCW treatment from the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) database. The “bibliometrix” package in R language, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace visualization software were utilized for the analysis. The results revealed a fluctuating upward trend in the annual number of publications, indicating ongoing deepening and development of research in this field. India and China exhibited the strongest research capacity, forming a cooperation network centered around these two countries. High-impact journals such as Desalination and Water Treatment, Journal of Hazardous Materials, and Chemical Engineering Journal frequently publish research related to FCW treatment. Keyword co-occurrence and burst analysis revealed that the current research hotspots in FCW treatment primarily focus on treatment methods (ion exchange, chemical coagulation/precipitation, adsorption, electrochemical, membrane separation, and fluidized bed crystallization), adsorption mechanism, and adsorbent design and optimization. Future research will likely focus on developing efficient treatment technologies and adsorption materials for FCW, as well as the recovery of fluoride resources from FCW, highlighting a dual approach to environmental sustainability and resource management. By employing bibliometrics, this study outlines the development status of FCW treatment and predicts the field's future trends, providing insights for understanding the development trajectory of this field. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Urolithiasis is the most prevalent benign urological condition, imposing a significant burden on morbidity, disability, and healthcare costs globally. Despite its impact, comprehensive bibliometric analyses of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) related to urolithiasis, which are essential for advancing evidence-based medical practices, are lacking. This study aimed to examine the global research landscape and trends in RCTs focused on urolithiasis. This study used bibliometric techniques to analyze a selection of RCTs on urolithiasis published between 1979 and 2023. VOSviewer software version 1.6.20 was used to visualize international collaborations and perform a keyword analysis of the included articles. The main objective was to identify key research areas and focal points within the field of urolithiasis RCTs. Between 1979 and 2023, a comprehensive search identified 16,716 research articles on urolithiasis. A total of 693 relevant RCTs were found in the Scopus database. The number of publications has significantly increased over time, indicating a strong positive correlation (R² = 0.9303; P < 0.001). China was the top contributor, with 166 publications (23.95%), followed by the United States, with 130 publications (18.76%). Turkey and Iran contributed 44 (6.35%) and 62 (8.95%) publications, respectively. Citation analysis revealed an average of 28.13 citations per article, an h-index of 70, and a total of 19,493 citations. The co-occurrence analysis highlighted current research trends and key topics in urolithiasis RCTs, including ‘comparative effectiveness of surgical and laser techniques and patient outcomes’, ‘medical expulsive therapy (MET) for ureteral calculi and clinical outcomes’, ‘systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs investigating urolithiasis’, and ‘dietary interventions and correlations between stone composition and the risk of recurrence.’ The bibliometric analysis provides an overview of research on urolithiasis RCTs. It examines global research trends and identifies new developments in the field. Our review identified key research themes, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, dietary interventions, medical therapy for the expulsion of ureteral stones, and comparisons of surgical techniques—areas that will remain focal points in future research. This bibliometric analysis is an invaluable resource for researchers, clinicians, and policymakers, providing a complete overview of past and present research trends. Informed decision making can be promoted and guided in future research, ultimately improving management and understanding. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Advanced brain organoids provide promising platforms for deciphering the cellular and molecular processes of human neural development and diseases. Although various studies and reviews have described developments and advancements in brain organoids, few studies have comprehensively summarized and analyzed the global trends in this area of neuroscience. To identify and further facilitate the development of cerebral organoids, we utilized bibliometrics and visualization methods to analyze the global trends and evolution of brain organoids in the last 10 years. First, annual publications, countries/ regions, organizations, journals, authors, co-citations, and keywords relating to brain organoids were identified. The hotspots in this field were also systematically identified. Subsequently, current applications for brain organoids in neuroscience, including human neural development, neural disorders, infectious diseases, regenerative medicine, drug discovery, and toxicity assessment studies, are comprehensively discussed. Towards that end, several considerations regarding the current challenges in brain organoid research and future strategies to advance neuroscience will be presented to further promote their application in neurological research. © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

AB  - Background: Macrophages are key regulators of the inflammatory and innate immune responses. Researchers have shown that aberrant expression of macrophages contributes to the development of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). However, a comprehensive bibliometric analysis exploring the research status and knowledge mapping of this area is lacking. This study aimed to explore the research status, knowledge mapping and hotspots of macrophages in AAA research from a bibliometric perspective. Methods: In this study, we retrieved articles published between 2000 and 2022 on macrophages associated with AAA research from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database. The retrieved literature data were further analyzed using Citespace and VOSviewer software. Results: A total of 918 qualified publications related to AAA-associated macrophages were retrieved. The number of publications in this field has been increasing annually. China and the United States were the 2 main drivers in this field, contributing to more than 64% of the publications. In addition, the US had the most publications, top institutions, and expert researchers, dominating in research on macrophages in AAA. The Harvard University was the most productive institution, with 60 publications. The journal with the most publications was Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (86). Daugherty Alan was the most prolific author (28 publications) and he was also the most cited co- author. Furthermore, the exploration of established animal models, macrophage-related inflammatory-microenvironment, macrophage-related immune mechanism, clinical translation and molecular imaging research remained future research directions in this field. Conclusions: Our findings offered new insights for scholars in this field. They will help researchers explore new directions for their work.  Copyright © 2024 the Author(s).

AB  - Using a bibliometric analysis and a systematic review of relevant literature, this study explores the strategic resource dimension of the Resource-Based View (RBV) theory and its application to corporate governance. To find pertinent articles in the Web of Science Core Collection published between 2014 and 2024, a methodical search strategy was used. A critical qualitative content analysis was carried out for the systematic review, and the bibliometric analysis was performed using the R-bibliometrix package. The analysis showed a steady interest in the RBV-corporate governance interface in research. Thematic analysis revealed long-standing interests in competitive advantage and dynamic capabilities alongside new fields like organisational resilience and artificial intelligence. By incorporating RBV principles into corporate governance procedures, resources can be strategically managed for long-term efficacy and competitiveness. By using the research's findings, organisations can modernise their approaches to strategic management, allocate resources more effectively, encourage accountability and transparency in governance frameworks, and make investments in the creation of dynamic capabilities. © 2024

AB  - Energy poverty, understood as the lack of access to adequate and sufficient energy services, constitutes a severe development problem for the African continent. Even though several policies and alleviation measures have been implemented in the last few decades, African countries still face multiple challenges. Therefore, this paper aims to identify these challenges related to energy poverty alleviation in Africa and the suitable solutions to address them. Using a mixed methods approach, involving a bibliometric analysis and a survey of involved actors, the study identifies the current constraints, obstacles and measures to address the problem in African countries. Findings point out to governance-related issues, including corruption and poor policy implementation, as the most indicated reasons for energy poverty in Africa, more than technological, financial, and policy issues. The results also confirm the fact that energy poverty has various roots and addressing it needs to take into account challenges related to outdated infrastructure, limited accessibility, and high prices. Moreover, there is often a lack of awareness about the benefits of renewable energy sources and energy-efficient practices, which suggests research in this field is also needed. The novelty of this study resides in the fact that it reviews the literature on the topic, describes its variables associated with the problem, and presents the views and perspectives from people familiar with the topic. The insights from this research can inform policymakers and infrastructure planners, helping them to prioritise investments and design interventions that address the root causes of energy poverty and its various manifestations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - By 2030, the UN General Assembly issued Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6), which calls for the provision of safe drinking water; however, little progress has been made. Wastewater treatment and reuse have garnered significant attention owing to the increasing demand for sanitation and sustainable development practices. Multiple methods have been designed and tested, among which Aerobic Granular Sludge-based treatment is rapidly emerging as a promising treatment option. Aerobic Granular Sludge (AGS) plants have been the focus of research due to their low energy consumption, small footprint, and low unit costs. However, the full-scale application of AGS may be hindered by constraints such as strict nitrogen and phosphorus discharge standards, frequent and large temperature fluctuations, and fluctuating influent flow volume. Despite the existence of a few reviews related to AGS technology, there is a need for an extensive review coupled with a research progress analysis that provides comprehensive information on the nuances of AGS, which prompted this article. AGS technique and research progress in AGS are identified through a scientometric lens is reviewed in this article. The topics covered include the generation of AGS through the use of technology, usage, challenges associated with managing AGS plants, and a comparison between AGS and other methods of energy storage. An analysis was conducted to understand the keywords for which research is currently active: authors who have conducted more research, collaboration, and other bibliometric factors associated with AGS research. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The relationship between disruption and delayed recognition is a critical research topic, yet the connection between the degree of disruption and delayed acknowledgment remains unclear. This study investigates the extent of recognition delay for disruptive papers using the SciSciNet dataset. We conducted a quantitative analysis based on this extensive dataset to examine the relationship between the Disruption Index and the Sleeping Beauty Index, revealing that highly disruptive papers often face a latency period before gaining acknowledgment, with significant variations across disciplines and over time. Our analysis of team dynamics indicates that larger teams, the presence of high-impact authors, fixed teams, and hierarchically structured teams can significantly reduce this delay. These findings provide insights into optimizing team strategies and understanding the complexities of academic recognition. They offer valuable implications for researchers and policymakers aiming to foster and accelerate the acknowledgment of groundbreaking scientific contributions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Rock mechanics is an indispensable discipline in diverse sectors, from resource retrieval to disaster mitigation. Diving deeper into this field, particularly into microscale rock mechanics, offers strategic insights and potential advancements for rock engineering practice. The objective of this research is to map the scientific production tied to microscale rock mechanics to date. In doing so, we perform a bibliometric analysis to look over and discuss the performance of the related literature. The conceptual fabric of microscale rock mechanics research, constituted by four central themes, was revealed and visualized through a text mining analysis. These areas include (1) modeling and simulation of fluid flow and transport within porous media, (2) characterizing fracture and failure in rocks, (3) understanding the deformation mechanism in response to geological processes, and (4) studying the mechanical properties of rocks subjected to extreme conditions. Lastly, an upcoming research agenda for microscale rock mechanics was proposed, centered on addressing three identified research gaps: (I) the integration of geological processes to characterize mineral properties, (II) the augmentation of fracture predictions achieved through multiscale modeling of rock heterogeneity, and (III) the exploitation of Artificial Intelligence technologies for anticipating complex fracturing scenarios. This comprehensive approach promises to enrich our understanding of rock mechanics and its applications. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This study evaluates the knowledge structure of microplastic pollution and its effects on the aquatic food chain. The presence of microplastics has seriously harmed the ecosystem. Through bibliometric analysis, 216 journal publications were retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) from 2008 to 2023 (April), with no restriction in the time frame. Applying bibliographic coupling and co-word analysis, the emerging, current, and future themes of microplastic pollution are presented. Three research streams are derived from bibliographic coupling, centralized on the source of microplastic pollution and its impact. At the same time, research streams from co-word analysis are associated with overcoming the issue of microplastics in the ecosystem. This study's implications suggest three main principles to mitigate microplastic issues: (1) educating the public on the impact of microplastic pollution, (2) implementing holistic regulations and policies, and (3) developing treatment strategies through conventional, innovative, and hybrid approaches. Microplastic pollution is a global concern, requiring a holistic and comprehensive approach to overcome it. This review is the first to present a scientific mapping of the microplastics literature, which is a fundamental basis for future research on microplastic pollution and its impact on the ecosystem.

AB  - Bibliometric analysis has recently become a popular and rigorous technique used for exploring and analyzing the literature in business and management. Prior studies principally focused on ‘how to do bibliometric analysis’, presenting an overview of the bibliometric methodology along with various techniques and step-by-step guidelines that can be relied on to rigorously conduct bibliometric analysis. However, the current body of evidence is limited in its ability to provide practical knowledge that can enhance the design and performance of bibliometric research. This claim is supported even by the fact that relevant studies refer to their work as ‘bibliometric analysis’ rather than ‘bibliometric research’. Accordingly, we endeavor to offer a more functional framework for researchers who wish to design/conduct bibliometric research on any field of research, especially business and management. To do this, we followed a twofold way. We first outlined the main stages and steps of typical bibliometric research. Then, we proposed a comprehensive framework for specifying how to design/conduct the research and under what headings the relevant stages (step-by-step) will be used and/or presented. Thus, the current paper is expected to be a useful source to gain insights into the available techniques and guide researchers in designing/conducting bibliometric research. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Amid concerns about financial social responsibility, the significance of ethical standards in trading has grown. Recent years have seen increased focus on exploring diverse ethics in trading, from fundamental principles to cutting-edge techniques. Our objective is to shed light on the state of ethics in trading through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 3010 research articles published between 1976 and 2022, drawing data from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoS). This analysis includes identifying publications, examining co-authorship patterns, determining top countries in scientific output, analyzing citations, exploring influential journals, and assessing keyword co-occurrence. Recurring themes mirror the academic progression of ethics in trading, especially regarding new technologies like high-frequency trading, offering insights for future research. Two standout considerations are the ethical implications of short selling in high-frequency trading and ethical management in commodity trading, linked to the evolving landscape of social responsibility in trade management. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Arbitration has a long history of resolving disputes, particularly in the construction industry. The benefits of arbitration performance and effectiveness were well promoted, along with its adverse issues. This article aims to examine the evolution trends of arbitration over the last decade based on published articles in the Web of Science and Scopus database library using bibliometric and content analysis. To the best awareness, this investigation was instigated by the lack of a comprehensive literature analysis of the published articles. From the 89 shortlisted articles finalized following the PRISMA 2020 protocol, the findings through Biblioshiny and VOSviewer helped answer the article's objectives on the investigation after harmonizing it with the OpenRefine software. Findings indicated the need for an effective framework to address all the issues of past concern within a single body of knowledge to enhance the performance of arbitration. The findings of this article aim to inform stakeholders in the construction industry about the progression of arbitration performance. Meanwhile, construction industry stakeholders and scholars can investigate ways to enhance arbitration methods with the results to delve into the emphasized themes and at the same time, this analysis method may encourage other researchers to pursue their areas of interest similarly. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - This paper proposes a method to evaluate academic impact that focuses on spatial context in which citations occur in sections of citing papers. Previous studies measured impact of papers using external factors such as journals, time, and authors. However, these methods overlooks context of citations, leading to problem of treating papers with same citation counts equivalently. To overcome this issue, we designed a citation network by reflecting on the spatial context in which cited papers are cited in the citing paper and measured their impact. Spatial context is defined by the specific section of the citing paper (Introduction, Method, Result, Discussion, Conclusion) where the citation appears. We collected 818 citing papers and 13,257 cited papers from 2013–2022 from Journal of Informetrics and constructed a context-reflected citation network. Further, we utilized CRITIC method and weighted PageRank algorithm for measuring section-specific weights and impact. Results obtained in this study suggest that the impact of cited papers varies significantly depending on the section context in which they appear. We use Kendall τ coefficient for analyzing correlation between “times cited” rankings and contextual PageRank. The Kendall τ coefficient between two ranks for entire dataset is 0.473. This study provides a multidimensional framework to assess the impact of academic papers, suggesting that future evaluations should consider not only the number of citations but also their context. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To identify collaboration trends with coauthors, this paper elaborates a theoretical framework by introducing a measure to quantify exploration of the author in joining teams of coauthors with respect to the extreme exploration possibilities. Using the clustering coefficient, we gauge the team exploration from the author-centric vista evaluating configuration values of the ego networks. This value is normalized with respect to the maximum exploration possibilities for the author facilitating us to derive a measure, viz., the team exploration score for the team exploration strategy. We further derive a dynamical version of this measure. The average profiles of the exploration strategies are compared for the authors from the USA, England, and India publishing in a rapidly growing and collaboration-extensive field, viz. artificial intelligence in computer science, in the time window from 1990 to 2020. The bibliometric data are sourced from the Clarivate Web of Science. Configuration values are evaluated in the ascending year of publications in year-long time windows to compute the team exploration score for each author. Our analysis shows that the annually averaged profiles of authors corresponding to the three countries are almost constantly increasing toward high team exploration scores.

AB  - This study explored the scientometrics and current dynamics of the area of sharing economy business models (SEBMs). Using bibliometric analysis, it examined a collection of 561 studies from the Web of Science and Scopus databases to detect the thematic evolution, strategy map, and emerging trends in SEBM literature as well as to forecast research directions. The results showed that SEBMs is a relatively new multidisciplinary research area that grew rapidly between 2014 and 2019; since then, the publication growth has flattened. Research on SEBMs currently focuses on sustainability, sustainable development, tourism, new technology application, and business management, with less attention given to social effects and public acceptance, determinants of success, and regional entrepreneurial ecosystem. The thematic analysis revealed that sustainability-oriented themes are at the center. Six emerging trends were detected: (1) industry-oriented research such as transportation, tourism, accommodation, energy, and others, (2) sustainability-oriented studies, including social, environmental, and economic perspectives, (3) sustainable organizational development concerning social acceptance, trust, legitimacy, and satisfaction, (4) new technology-oriented and innovation-focused studies such as blockchain, big data, social media, and e-platforms, (5) country- and region-oriented studies, particularly for emerging countries, (6) effects of entrepreneurial ecosystem factors on SEBM development. Based on the current thematic map and evolution, this paper suggests several critical research directions. The paper provides (1) providing a one-stop literature overview on SEBM area for two time slices: fast-growing-initiation phase (before COVID-19) and transitional phase (during COVID-19), (2) identifying research focuses, emerging trends, and gaps, (3) developing novel research avenues for investigation, and (4) aligning expected contributions to the area. By providing new knowledge, the research theoretically contributes to many disciplines given that SEBM studies were found to be multidisciplinary. It also has numerous implications for policymakers and practitioners. © 2023 The Authors. R&D Management published by RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Climate change and CO2 emissions are critical challenges for the environment and humanity. There is extensive literature on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, in particular CO2 emissions. However, comprehensive analyses focusing on electric vehicles (EVs) and their impact are lacking. This study fills this gap by conducting a bibliometric analysis of 1143 peer-reviewed studies from 1989 to 2023. We aimed to identify influential contributions, understand the field's structure, and reveal research gaps. Analysis included citation networks, research impact, authorship patterns, content, and publication trends. We utilized bibliometric techniques to identify the most dominant countries, institutions, authors, journals, articles, and thematic areas related to EVs and emissions. Additionally, we overviewed publications associated with key search terms. Guided by five research dimensions (EVs, emissions, adoption, policies, and infrastructures), we framed specific research questions. This research provides valuable insights for environmentalists, policymakers, regulators, and academic researchers, facilitating access to crucial data on EVs and emissions. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2024.

AB  - Background: Melasma is a prevalent pigmented disease, yet its pathogenesis remains unclear, posing challenges for effective treatment. Bibliometric analysis, a novel approach to literature research, offers the opportunity to evaluate research trends through qualitative and quantitative methods. This study utilizes bibliometric methods to analyze the existing literature on melasma treatment, examining influential publications, institutions, countries, and authors through statistical analysis. Methods: In order to retrieve manuscripts related to the topic of melasma treatment, we conducted a search using the search formula: (TS = (melasma or Chloasma or “mask of pregnancy”)) AND TS = (treatment or therapy). We searched through the Web of Science Core Collection database, covering publications from 2000 to 2023. VOSviewer, CiteSpace and the Bibliometric online site (https://bibliometric.com/app) were used to conduct this bibliometric analysis. Our analysis focused on various factors including publications, authors co-authorship, institutions, countries, citation analysis, keywords co-occurrence, references co-citation and journal co-citation. Results: A total of 943 articles and 200 reviews were published between 2000 and 2023, accumulating a total of 8628 citations. The average number of citations per item was 18.85, and the average number of citations per year was 292.69. The most prolific author, Sungeun Chang, contributed a total of 9 articles. Cario University emerged as the top research institution. The United States led in terms of article publications with a count of 276. In the past 5 years, the research trends in this field have primarily focused on tranexamic acid and epidermal melasma, as indicated by the burst analysis of publications and keywords. Conclusions: The United States continues to lead in terms of institutions and research output. The current emphasis is on the meticulous implementation of tranexamic acid and laser therapy. It is crucial to foster enhanced collaboration among countries, institutions, and authors to facilitate improved research. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Redox flow batteries (RFB) are receiving increasing attention as promising stationary energy storage systems. However, while first innovation activities in this technological field date back to the 1950s, the commercialization and diffusion rates of RFB technology have remained limited. Apart from technological challenges, the lack of a functioning innovation system is one of the main barriers to mainstream this technology. Here, we carried out a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the RFB research field to shed systematic light on a core aspect of innovation systems - the production of knowledge. Based on the analysis of 4,872 papers published in the years 1981–2021, we reveal developments over time, describe the geographical distribution of research activities, and explore collaboration networks as well as emerging lines of research. Overall, our study allows for strengthening the RFB innovation system by providing the foundation for aligning a scattered research field, identifying needs for technology development, and fostering collaboration and synergy creation. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - CiteSpace was used to visualize the knowledge map structure of literatures related to “ Fenton and Fenton-like AOPs ” in CNKI and WOS databases, in order to identify the direction and focus of future research and provide some reference and reference for relevant degradation technology decision-making. The results show that:1) Domestic literature on the degradation of pollutants by Fenton and Fenton-like oxidation process showed obvious fluctuations，the overall growth trend was slow; the general trend of the number of published papers abroad was a slow growth, after 2020, the number of foreign publications had steadily increased. 2) The group of authors in this field at home and abroad was generally small concentration and large dispersion, which needs to strengthen cooperation. Research on Fenton and fenton-like advanced oxidation technology (AOPs) degraded pollutants in our country had not yet formed a stable core authors group, while foreign research in this field had formed a stable core authors group. 3) From the perspective of research institutions, whether at home or abroad, universities, research institutes and laboratories of relevant ministries and commissions were the main undertakers of scientific research, and cooperation among research institutions need to be strengthened. 4) In China, there was more cooperation in the research field of pollutants degraded by Fenton and Fenton-like AOPs, while in foreign countries, although there was overlap, the scope was small, and some clusters were scattered, indicating that there was less cooperation in the keyword research of each cluster. 5) The time span of domestic research in this field was not large, and even the situation of research interruption occurred in a few years, while the time span of foreign research was more continuous. © 2024

AB  - Housing inequality is a pressing issue that affects the lives of millions of people worldwide. This study aims to determine trends, generate insights, and identify knowledge gaps in housing inequality research by systematically mapping and analysing the academic literature. As for the systematic literature review method, the PRISMA approach is employed to review literature published during the last four decades. The review is enriched with bibliometric analytics—e.g., research trends; influential publications, co-occurrence network of terms, geographical distribution—and content analysis techniques to provide future research directions. The analysis revealed four main research themes, comprising housing discrimination, housing market and urbanisation, the relationship of housing inequality with health and education, and housing inequalities among the young adult population. The majority of these studies centred their research on China. The findings in the following areas consolidate the understanding of housing inequality: (a) Housing inequality as a product of housing market dynamics; (b) Housing inequality as a condition affecting different segments of the population disparately; (c) Housing inequality as a socio-cultural concept; (d) Housing inequality as an outcome of public policy. This study advocates for multifaceted policy interventions, and the findings, which contribute to achieving relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), provide insights for urban and housing policymakers and urban planners in addressing housing inequality problems. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: Radiotherapy, as the main treatment method for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), has evolved over time, but there has been no bibliometric study on NPC radiotherapy to date. In our study, the scientific achievements of NPC radiotherapy around the world were evaluated by bibliometric analyses, and the previous research hotspots and future trends are described. Methods: Original articles related to NPC radiotherapy were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection. To identify research hotspots and future trends, countries/regions, institutions, journals, references, authors, and keywords were evaluated and visualized by Excel, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace. Results: From 1959 to 2022, 7139 original articles were collected. The annual publications showed an increasing trend, especially after 2011. China had the most publications (n = 3719, 52.09 %). Sun Yat-sen University has the most publications and citations among institutions. Jun Ma is most productive and SR Baker has the highest co-cited centrality. International Journal of Radiation Oncology-Biology-Physics is the core journal, with most publications, citations and co-citations. Analysis of keywords showed intensity-modulated radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy were the main keywords, and multicenter showed the strongest burst. Conclusion: NPC radiotherapy has attracted increasing attention, and precision and artificial intelligence may be the future trends in this field. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Myopia is the most common refractive error worldwide, contributing not only to visual impairment but also serving as a potential risk factor for various severe ocular diseases. Its impact on patients' quality of life and health is significant and imposes substantial socioeconomic burdens. In this study, we analyzed the top 100 most cited articles related to myopia published in the Web of Science Core Collection database from January 2000 to February 2024. Using data visualization tools CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Scimago Graphica, we identified the most influential research papers and academic journals in the field of myopia. The top 100 most influential articles were published in 25 renowned journals across 30 countries, with Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science being the most prolific. Ophthalmology had the highest total citation frequency, while The Lancet had the highest average citation frequency. The United States and the National University of Singapore were the top countries and institutions with the most published papers. The 3 major research directions are Ophthalmology, Medicine, General & Internal, and Genetics & Heredity. The top 5 co-occurring keywords were refractive error, risk factors, prevalence, eye growth, and form-deprivation myopia. Cluster analysis results highlighted focal points such as retinal detachment, high myopia, and contrast sensitivity, indicating potential future research trends. Prospective research directions include investigating the pathogenesis of myopia, updating diagnostic technologies, and identifying risk genes for myopia and its complications.  © 2024 the Author(s).

AB  - The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has distinct attributes that provide the necessary elements for conducting studies and preparing articles that highlight its relevance in identifying water resources. This article presents an analysis of research publications, from a bibliometric perspective, on radar remote sensing for the detection of bodies of water. This analysis was carried out over the period from 1980 to 2023. For data, a total of 7002 academic publications were retrieved from the Scorpus database. The Rstudio software was adopted to evaluate the number of publications per year, most productive countries, frequency of keywords and most influential magazines in specific terms in mapping and detection of bodies of water using radar images. The results pointed to a growing trend in annual publications, with a notable increase from 2012 onwards, driven mainly by the availability of Sentinel-1 data and the development of methods based on Deep Learning. Keywords like "Remote Sensing" and "Surface waters" were the most common. Although European countries presented the highest frequency of articles, it is important to highlight that China and the United States led in terms of number of publications. This analysis has the potential to assist researchers and scholars in understanding the intellectual structure of this field more deeply and identifying future research directions. © 2024, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the structure of growing publications on Islamic leadership and its contribution to organizational effectiveness and long-term success using bibliometric analysis with VOSviewer. The sample population comprised all publications of the Scopus database from 2010 to 2023. In addition, a total of 244 publications were selected for bibliometric analysis and visualization, including original study articles, book chapters, reviews, conference papers, and other forms of literature written in English. The results showed the presence of three clusters, namely red (Indonesia, Malaysia, Egypt, and United Arab Emirates), green (United States, Iraq, Syrian Arab Republic, and Turkey), and blue (Iran, Israel, and China). These clusters represented regional cooperation in the exploration of Islamic leadership publications and their implications for organizational development. The results also showed that Islamic leadership was most commonly applied in education, psychology, community and health care, school, and government sectors. In addition, it was shown to be frequently related to trust, job performance, motivation, decision-making, job satisfaction, and empowerment. Islamic leadership placed great emphasis on motivation and job performance, as it ultimately recognized the importance of productive and purposeful work in employees’ lives and society’s overall well-being. Based on these results, Islamic leadership supported employees in achieving healthy work-life integration by encouraging time for family, worship of Allah (the God), and personal well-being.

AB  - This paper presents a bibliometric review on biogas reforming for the production of sustainable aviation fuel. The central themes are catalyst stability and syngas H2/CO ratio. It begins with a summary of bibliometric data, literature trends, and most productive agents. Followed by citation analysis on dry reforming (DR) and steam reforming (SR), including internal reforming in fuel cells. Then, a statistical exploration of literature data on reforming in nickel catalysts, followed by the thermodynamic effects of temperature, pressure, and H2O/CH4 ratio. For Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, steam reforming appears as the best option. The biggest gaps in the biogas reforming literature are kinetic studies and pressure effect assessments, for scale-up. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to conduct a bibliometric analysis on “intertemporal choice” behavior of individuals from journals in the Scopus database between 1957 and 2023. The research covered the data on the said topic since it first originated in the Scopus database and carried out performance analysis and content analysis of papers in the business management and finance disciplines. Design/methodology/approach: Bibliometric analysis, including science mapping and performance analysis, followed by content analysis of the papers of identified clusters, was conducted. Three clusters based on cocitation analysis and six themes (three major and three minor) were identified using the bibliometrix package in R studio. The content analysis of the papers in these clusters and themes have been discussed in this study, along with the thematic evolution of intertemporal choice research over the period of time, paving a way for future research studies. Findings: The review unpacks publication and citation trends of intertemporal choice behavior, the most significant authors, journals and papers along with the major clusters and themes of research based on cocitation and degree of centrality and relevance, respectively, i.e. discounting experiments and intertemporal choice, impulsivity, risk preference, time-inconsistent preference, etc. Originality/value: Over the past years, the research on “intertemporal choice” has flourished because of the increasing interest of researchers and scholars from different fields and the dynamic and pervasive nature of this topic. The well-developed and scattered body of knowledge on intertemporal choice has led to the need of applying a bibliometric analysis in the intertemporal choice literature. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The article is devoted to review the data regarding the identification of biochemicaand functional features of the components of the renin-angiotensin system using the tools of bibliometric analysis of scientific literature. A modern interpretation by the dividing of the multifunctional complex into two systems, namely the classical renin-angiotensin system and alternative renin-angiotensin system, in accordance with the definition of biological effects, is given. The enzymatic cascade involved in the pro-duction and metabolism of peptides in both classical and non-classical pathways orenin-angiotensin systems is shown from the point of view of the evolution of scientific concepts. The triggering role of components of the classical renin-angiotensin system in pathophysiological processes with transformation into cardiovascular diseases and metabolic dysfunction has been proven. The history of the creation of pharmacologicadrugs for the correction of the classic renin-angiotensin system is presented. In view of the achievement of recent years, the revision of the alternative renin-angiotensin system is emphasized due to the discovery of the counter-regulatory action of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, angiotensin-(1 — 7), the Mas receptor in relation to their correction of metabolic processes, regulation of blood pressure, and the presence of anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The positive effect othe components of the non-classical renin-angiotensin system on the protection of the cardiovascular system and kidney is presented based on the results of experimentastudies on animals. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics characteristics of recom-binant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in experiments on healthy volunteers are highlighted. The potential protective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and angiotensin-(1 — 7) concerning cardiometabolic risk are presented. The available data indicate the need for further comprehensive scientific investigations of the componentof alternative renin-angiotensin system to create a new class of pharmacological agentwith their implementation in medical practice. © 2024, Ukr.

AB  - The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index is a crucial marker of insulin resistance, as evidenced by numerous studies related to metabolic diseases. This bibliometric analysis investigates research trends associated with the TyG index over the past 24 years. We collected data on TyG index publications from January 1, 2000, to January 7, 2024, using the Web of Science database. Analysis was conducted utilizing VOSviewer, Scimago Graphica, and CiteSpace to evaluate publication metrics, citations, countries, institutions, authors, journals, and keywords. A total of 1163 publications from 354 journals authored by 6149 researchers across 60 countries were analyzed. China emerged as the leading contributor, with 654 publications (56.23%). Capital Medical University was the most productive institution, and Wu Shouling was the top author. Cardiovascular Diabetology was identified as the most influential journal. Key emerging research directions include the role of the TyG index as a representative marker for insulin resistance, particularly concerning insulin sensitivity; its association with body mass index and hyperuricemia; and its diagnostic and prognostic value in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiovascular conditions such as acute coronary syndrome, carotid plaque, and hypertension. Current trends favor cohort studies predominantly involving adult populations. Overall, China leads TyG index research, focusing on its connections to insulin sensitivity, body mass index, and hyperuricemia, while the index's diagnostic and prognostic significance for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiovascular diseases represents an expanding research frontier. © 2024 the Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited research exists on pricing policies from a bibliometric and visualization perspective, and there is a lack of understanding of their typology. This study aims to address these gaps in knowledge and provide a deeper understanding of the research topics and development trends in this field. METHODS: A bibliometric study was conducted on drug pricing approaches in healthcare literature, published between 2000 and June 2023. The literature was identified through an extensive search of healthcare databases and was then classified based on the year of publication, research topics, corresponding authors, location of corresponding authors, and journal titles. The citation data analysis was conducted using Bibliometrix, which consisted of descriptive, geographical, and time-series analyses and visualization. RESULTS: Between 2000 and June 2023, 173 articles were disseminated across 98 distinct publication sources. During the analysis, we observed a significant and consistent rise in literature reports on drug pricing approaches in healthcare, especially in 2010. The research topics were distributed almost equally, discussing improvement or issues with drug pricing models and addressing drug pricing applications. Our analysis revealed that the top ten corresponding authors were responsible for 19% of the total articles, with those based in the United States being the most productive. Furthermore, the "Health Economics" journal ranked first among the top ten journals. These findings align with the overall publication trends of drug pricing methods reported in other fields. CONCLUSIONS: The current study offers a comprehensive overview of drug pricing techniques utilized in medicine through visualization and bibliometric techniques. Analysis of authors, journals, institutions, and countries could serve as a reference for new researchers and guide them differently. Researchers can also consider emerging trends when determining the focus of their studies. Copyright © 2024 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - With the increasing promotion of digital technology, safety issues faced by rush ships in the maritime industry have once again received attention. Ship collision avoidance (SCA) is not only a hot topic in the shipping industry but also an eye-catching issue in the development of intelligent ships. This paper provides a bibliometric and systematic overview of the literature on SCA to assist researchers in understanding the frontiers and recent trends of SCA. Based on the bibliographic portrait, a classification and grading study was conducted on the literature to provide a systematic review of it. A screening process was conducted on 851 relevant articles related to SCA and published in 2004–2023 in the Web of Science (WoS) database, and 526 highly relevant and high-quality papers were selected. Then, CiteSpace, VOSviewer software, and data visualization techniques were used to conduct a bibliographic portrait analysis on the selected papers. The evidence from these systematic literature reviews revealed the close collaboration relationships among researchers, research institutions, and countries or regions in the field of SCA studying shortly. Furthermore, the frontiers of the research on SCA were focused on three aspects, i.e. research subjects, technological methods, and novel algorithms in intelligent SCA. COLREG is a problem that must be considered in intelligent SCA. The future trends in intelligent SCA were explored and SCA technology was introduced from artificial intelligence (AI) so as to meet the safety requirement of maritime autonomous surface ships. AI algorithms such as machine learning and deep learning are key technologies for SCA. This research provides a theoretical basis and implementation directions of the research on SCA. The hybrid encounters between traditional ships and intelligent ships, as well as multi-ship encounters in narrow waterways, will be the focal points of attention in the future. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: Dental implants are an established treatment option for varying edentulous conditions that has grown in popularity since the 1990s. This increased clinical application has shown a parallel increase in implant-related research. The objective of this paper was to perform a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of five dental implantology journals from 1991 to 2023. Materials and Methods: A search was done in the Web of Science database between 1991 and 2023 in five journals with a focus on dental implantology: Clinical Oral Implant Research, Clinical Implant Dentistry and Related Research, Implant Dentistry, The International Journal of Oral & Maxillofacial Implants, and International Journal of Oral Implantology. Results marked as a correction, retraction notice, retracted article, meeting abstract, or withdrawn publication were removed from the analysis. The time period analyzed was divided into four time periods, organized by decade: 1991 to 2000, 2001 to 2010, 2011 to 2020, and 2021 to 2023. Additionally, the top 100 cited papers were also exported separately. Authors and countries with most publications were tabulated from the Web of Science database. VOSviewer software was used to create network maps of keywords and title word occurrences for each of the time periods. HistCite software was used to analyze the number of publications and citation counts. Results: Network maps of keywords and title word occurrences suggested an early focus on osseointegration and titanium implants between 1991 and 2000. Publications between 2001 and 2010 saw a focus on in vivo studies, implant surface, and peri-implantitis. Publications from 2011 and later saw a focus on bone regeneration, complications, and zygomatic implants. The USA ranked highest in total number of publications in all analyzed time periods. Conclusions: Within the limitations of the present study, a comprehensive bibliometric analysis from 1990 to 2023 was reported. Trends in keywords and titles of implant publications were identified in these journals, which mirrored the trends seen in clinical practice.

AB  - Environmental pollution from microplastics (MPs), an anthropogenically mediated menace to the biosphere, is a global concern. This research conducted a bibliometric analysis of MPs in soil and terrestrial ecosystems using R software and biblioshiny to analyze descriptive statistics, author contributions, documents, and conceptual struc-tures. The Scopus database was selected, and various keywords optimized the search. An analysis of research trends divided the timeline into three periods: period I (2012–2018), period II (2019–2021), and period III (2022). Results showed Wang J. as the author with the highest h-index, while Science of the Total Environment had an h-index of 43. In period I, research focused on MPs and plastic pollution, raising questions about their impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. Research found that MPs negatively affected soil organisms by decreasing growth rates and causing weight loss. In period II, research diversified, exploring interactions between MPs and heavy metals, bioaccumulation, phytotoxicity, soil pollution, and gut microbiota. Research revealed that MPs could influence heavy metal uptake by plants and affect bacterial community structures in soil. In period III, research emphasized oxidative stress, a common ecotoxicity response in plants and animals. MPs induced oxidative stress, leading to reactive oxygen species (ROS) buildup. Polyethylene MPs were more toxic to plant seedlings than polystyrene and polypropylene, causing significant oxidative stress. Similarly, oxidative stress impacts on soil organisms were highlighted when exposed to MPs and pesticides. Research in this area is expected to continue growing, aiding in delineating distinct research paths, particularly focusing on oxidative stress, bioaccumulation, and heavy metals. © 2024, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

AB  - The Internet has become a space where parents share their parenting experiences. However, citizenship education requires digital skills that go beyond the simple critical ability to evaluate virtual information and understand its relevance. This paper is a systematic literature review that examines the progress of parents’ citizenship participation in schools through information and communication technologies (ICT) over the period from 2016 to 2024. The study adopts a bibliometric approach and follows the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. It analyzes 50 articles in the context of the PRISMA declaration. It focuses on three main aspects: the panoramic vision of digital citizenship, the semantic connection between groups of interconnected terms, and the role of parents in shaping citizenship. The results reveal a notable 31.61% increase in par-ents’ civic participation in school, identifying parents’ expectations in their children’s learning as well as students’ civic participation in school, highlighting the use of digital technologies to foster collaborative and academic learning in the construction of ICT-mediated citizenship. © 2024 by the authors of this article.

AB  - Research into the factors influencing university-industry collaboration on public university spin-offs creation has focused on management, entrepreneurship, technology and innovation. This research began with a careful systematic literature review of 4427 scientific papers published in the last ten years (2014–2023) and accessible in the prestigious Web of Science core collection. A quantitative methodology was used, complemented by the use of the visual analysis tool Posit PBC™, formerly known as R Cloud Studio. This comprehensive approach facilitated the seamless ingestion of raw data into Biblioshyni, which is a web-based platform specialised in bibliometric analysis. This review has revealed compelling trends, particularly in terms of increasing diversity, the emergence of United Kingdom as a major player, and the central role of university-industry collaboration. Our systematic review identified influential authors in the field, including the prolific contributions of scholars such as D. Radicid, S. Ropers, Y. Li and R. Owen. We also identified important research institutions, such as Utrecht University in Netherlands, Lund University in Sweden and The University of Manchester in the UK. In addition, we have shown that countries such as the United Kingdom, China and USA have made a significant contribution to the volume of publications. The results highlighted a marked increase in the phenomenon of univeristy spin-offs over the past decade, as evidenced by the exponential growth in both publication output and citation rates. This empirical revelation was underpinned by a rigorous exploration of the Web of Science database, using a carefully crafted set of keywords. Thirty-seven pivotal studies were selected for in-depth review through a sophisticated selection process that adhered to the rigorous standards of the PRISMA methodology. The aim of this review is to improve understanding and encourage deeper exploration of spin-off-based public universities through collaboration between academia and industry. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Technology triggers business collaboration and partnership as well as becomes an essential part for disruptive business strategies. The literature on this topic is dispersed, and the chapter addresses this gap. This chapter aims to present a systematic literature review of academic studies in disruptive collaborative innovation frameworks and provide guidance for future research by identifying current research gaps. The study uses the PRISMA framework and collects literature from 2015 to 2023 from highly ranked academic venues with the final sample of 112 papers. The section is structured around the PRISMA framework, and results are reported accordingly. The analysis was conducted using a range of methods, including bibliometric analysis, multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), and text network analysis. The analysis of the literature is presented to identify the main areas of research as well as to gauge the emerging streams. The overall results suggest that this area is starting to develop with limited research available to date. The study identified four theoretical foundations for existing research, aligned with behavioral, network, resource-based (RBV), and knowledge-based views (KBV). The identified theoretical views and themes are discussed, and examples of the studies are provided. © 2024 Maria Prokofieva Published under exclusive licence by Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Rumen protected fat (RPF) has garnered significant attention in livestock nutrition research. The present study aimed to perform a bibliometric analysis on RPF research in ruminant nutrition to evaluate global research patterns and future trends. This study represents the first bibliometric analysis on this topic using data from Scopus database to examine publications from 1991 to july 2024. The bibliometric analysis was done using Scopus Bibliometrix and VOSviewer. We identified 148 relevant articles, with a noticeable increase in publications starting around 2006, peaking notably in 2019 and 2020. The Journal of Dairy Science emerged as the leading publisher in this field. M. Kreuzer was identified as the most prolific author. Cluster analysis revealed five main thematic areas: (1) dairy cow and physiology; (2) meat production and performance; (3) rumen fermentation and digestibility; (4) buffalo-specific studies; and (5) forage management. Notably, the application of RPF in large ruminants primarily focused on milk production and quality, while in small ruminants, it mainly addressed performance, carcass traits, and meat quality. Future research should explore under-studied areas such as meat quality, genetic expression, and performance in large ruminants, and on milk quality and production in small ruminants. ©2024 The authors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoon that infects approximately one-third of the human population. The parasite could transmit from mother to fetus in cases of acute infection during pregnancy and cause complications in the fetus. The bibliometric analysis is a popular research area that evaluates all the studies indexed in particular databases on a subject. METHODS: This article puts forth bibliometric review of the literature on maternal and congenital toxoplasmosis research indexed in the Web of Science database between 1945 and 2024. VOS viewer, Web of Science and MS Office Excel 17 programs were used in the study. RESULTS: The results of the search showed 1476 publications. The countries that most contributed to the literature were France (n=306, 20.73%), the USA (n=229, 15.52%), and Brazil (n=146, 9.89%). The most cited country was also France (n=10271, 35.52%), followed by the USA (n=9113, 31.51%), and England (n=2611, 9.03%). The top three countries by number of citations per document were Denmark (44.88), the USA (39.79) and France (33.57). The five departments with the most publications are Pediatrics (20.26%), General Internal Medicine (18.16%), Infectious Diseases (16.8%), Obstetrics (14.57%), and Immunology (11.86%). Wallon M. (n=57), Peyron F. (n=49), Thulliez P. (n=36) and Vilena I. (n=36) were the leading authors in terms of contribution to the literature. The five most published journals were Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (3.66%), Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2.78%), Lancet (2.3%), Presse Medicale (1.76%), and American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (1.63%). CONCLUSION: France is one of the countries that pays the most attention to congenital toxoplasmosis and compatible with this, in our study, the country with the highest number of studies on congenital toxoplasmosis was France. It is thought that drawing more attention to this issue and conducting more studies in countries where the disease is common might yield successful results, as in France.; Amaç: Toxoplasma gondii, insan popülasyonunun yaklaşık üçte birini enfekte eden zorunlu hücre içi bir protozoondur. Hamilelik sırasında akut enfeksiyon geçirilmesi durumunda parazit anneden fetüse geçebilir ve fetüste birtakım komplikasyonların ortaya çıkmasına neden olabilmektedir. Bibliyometrik analiz, bir konu hakkında veri tabanlarında indeklenen tüm yayınları araştıran popüler bir araştırma türüdür. Yöntemler: Çalışmamız, 1945 ile 2024 yılları arasında Web of Science veri tabanında indekslenen maternal ve konjenital toksoplazmoz araştırmalarına ilişkin literatürün bibliyometrik bir incelemesini ortaya koymaktadır. Çalışmada VOS viewer, Web of Science ve MS Office Excel 17 programları kullanılmıştır. Bulgular: Araştırmamız sonucunda 1945 ile 2024 yılları arasında maternal ve konjenital toksoplazmoz konularında toplam 1476 yayın saptanmıştır. Literatüre en çok katkı sağlayan ülkeler Fransa (n=306, %20,73), ABD (n=229, %15,52) ve Brezilya’dır (n=146, %9,89). Aynı zamanda en çok atıf yapılan ülke Fransa (n=10271, %35,52) olurken, bunu ABD (n=9113, %31,51) ve İngiltere (n=2611, %9,03) takip etmiştir. Yayın başına yapılan atıf sayısına göre ilk üç ülke Danimarka (44,88), ABD (39,79) ve Fransa’dır (33,57). En fazla yayın yapılan beş bölüm sırasıyla Çocuk (%20,26), Genel Dahiliye (%18,16), Enfeksiyon Hastalıkları (%16,8), Kadın Doğum (%14,57) ve İmmünolojidir (%11,86). Wallon M. (57), Peyron F. (49), Thulliez P. (36) ve Vilena I. (36) literatüre katkı açısından önde gelen yazarlardır. En fazla yayın yapılan beş dergi sırasıyla Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (%3,66), Journal of Clinical Microbiology (%2,78), Lancet (%2,3), Presse Medicale (%1,76) ve American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology’dir (%1,63).

AB  - Acid-modified biochar is a modified biochar material with convenient preparation, high specific surface area, and rich pore structure. It has great potential for application in the heavy metal remediation, soil amendments, and carrying catalysts. Specific surface area (SSA), average pore size (APS), and total pore volume (TPV) are the key properties that determine its adsorption capacity, reactivity, and water holding capacity, and an intensive study of these properties is essential to optimize the performance of biochar. But the complex interactions among the preparation conditions obstruct finding the optimal modification strategy. This study collected dataset through bibliometric analysis and used four typical machine learning models to predict the SSA, APS, and TPV of acid-modified biochar. The results showed that the extreme gradient boosting (XGB) was optimal for the test results (SSA R2 = 0.92, APS R2 = 0.87, TPV R2 = 0.96). The model interpretation revealed that the modification conditions were the major factors affecting SSA and TPV, and the pyrolysis conditions were the major factors affecting APS. Based on the XGB model, the modification conditions of biochar were optimized, which revealed the ideal preparation conditions for producing the optimal biochar (SSA = 727.02 m2/g, APS = 5.34 nm, TPV = 0.68 cm3/g). Moreover, the biochar produced under specific conditions verified the generalization ability of the XGB model (R2 = 0.99, RMSE = 12.355). This study provides guidance for optimizing the preparation strategy of acid-modified biochar and promotes its potentiality for industrial application. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Green logistics has become a crucial strategy towards the net-zero emission target. Despite the growing attention on the concept, its antecedents, practices, and performance outcomes remain unsettled. The extant literature provides contradictory and limited understandings of how to study these dynamics and outcomes, triggering, in some cases, a partial view of the subject, confusions, and paradoxes in understanding the dynamics between performance outcomes, green logistics practices (GLPs), and antecedents that drive them. To contribute to this field of knowledge, this study aims to examine the antecedents, practices, and outcomes of GLPs and the methodological and theoretical choices used in previous green logistics studies. Forty-five (45) papers published between 2011-2024 were extracted from Web of Science and Scopus following the PRISMA protocol. The review combined bibliometric and systematic methodological approaches. The outcome revealed an increasing body of GLPs with three (3) strands of literature on GLP operationalization: (1) multi-dimensional, (2) one-dimensional, and (3) bi-dimensional. Thematic analysis revealed that forty-four (44%) of the studies are grounded in resource-advantage theories, organizational theories, and system theories. We further found that ninety-one (91%) of the papers used cross-sectional designs and quantitative approaches. Studies from China (20.2%) dominate the field and most studies have been conducted on the logistics and manufacturing industries. Using the Antecedent-Decision-Outcomes (ADO) framework, the study identified fourteen (14) Antecedents of GLP: eight (8) internal and six (6) external factors, four (4) decisions that facilitate the acceleration of GLPs and five (5) broad outcomes of GLPs (i.e., business performance, supply chain sustainability, SC performance, logistics performance, and green performance. Following the Theory-Context-Methodology (TCM) framework, agenda for future research directions were proffered. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the current trends, DT is given more attention and has gained greater importance than in the past. It is an extremely useful for students for developing skills, as it is useful not only in the academic context but also in their personal and professional lives. The present systematic literature review research is a comprehensive analysis of the available literature related to DT studies that have been carried out in the Indian context, with specific reference to the student community. This study attempts to assess the Indian DT research and across the global research studies, such as the sample size, method of the study in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. A bibliometric analysis is performed using Vos software to identify the keywords. The study reveals that the number of research studies that have been done in India with reference to DT is just a tiny fraction when compared to those done on a global scale. Most of the DT-related studies carried out in India have targeted professional courses such as engineering and management studies. Only few studies have considered school students as subjects. Most studies are experimental and intervention based. Due to the identified knowledge gap, the current study recommends that a greater number of research studies be undertaken on fostering DT in schoolchildren, encouraging them to explore multiple ideas. Such studies would suggest ways to cultivate the creative potential for DT among students at an early developmental age, as it would be greatly beneficial in transforming their professional and personal lives for the better. © 2024, Prof.Dr. İskender AKKURT.

AB  - Purpose: Given the growing interest in the topic of knowledge management (KM) in family firms (FFs) and the subsequent increasing number of papers published, this study aims to review the field to identify and analyze the main themes and trends. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies bibliometric techniques to a sample of 146 papers published from 2007 to 2023 and their 8,126 unique cited references. Bibliometric coupling is performed on the sample papers to explore the current intellectual structure of the field of KM in FFs, whereas cocitations analysis is performed to investigate the different literature streams that served as roots for the development of such a field. Findings: Bibliographic coupling reveals that sample papers can be grouped into four clusters, and, through papers content analysis, the author identifies their core themes as knowledge sharing, innovation, knowledge-based dynamic capabilities and intellectual capital. Cocitation analysis of the cited references revealed four main clusters that can be considered the literature streams that served as roots for the development of the field, i.e. knowledge-based view, socioemotional wealth, strategic management and social capital (as a theory and as a resource). Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature on KM in FFs by extending prior systematic review efforts with bibliometric analyses and combining these results to highlight connections between the main research themes around which scholars have debated (i.e. the clusters identified through bibliometric coupling) and their theoretical foundations (i.e. the clusters identified through cocitation analysis). This study also has practical implications by synthesizing and informing managers about FFs’ advantages and weaknesses in the KM process. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Augmented Reality (AR) involves the live presentation of digital objects within the real environment, offering supplementary details to tangible objects and facilitating interactive experiences. The benefits of AR in education, including heightened interest and motivation and enhanced learning enjoyment, render AR a captivating technology. Research on AR in education also becomes an intriguing topic to explore. In this study, we conducted bibliometric analysis to uncover trends and developments in AR research. We selected 568 articles from the Scopus database that met publication criteria, focusing on the field of education, in English, and in the form of articles rather than books, spanning from 2014 to 2023. The results showed that AR-related publications have been increasing since 2014, with significant growth since 2019, reaching its peak with a 100% increase in 2023. This rise was driven by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The United States leads in the number of AR publications, followed by technologically advanced countries occupying the top 10 positions. Keywords most frequently used alongside AR include Virtual reality, education, e-learning, and technology. Future bibliometric research can delve deeper with broader databases and different time ranges to continue tracking developments in AR-related research trends. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc..

AB  - Purpose: This paper presents a comprehensive study using bibliometric and social network analysis (SNA) to depict the academic community, research hotspots and the correlation between research performance and social network measurements within Library Hi Tech. Design/methodology/approach: Publications from Library Hi Tech between 2010 and 2022 are reviewed and analysed through coauthorship analysis, co-occurrence analysis, SNA and the Spearman rank correlation test. Findings: The annual number of publications in Library Hi Tech increased from 2016 to 2022, indicating that this research has gradually gained global attention. The USA and China are the most significant contributors to the relevant publications. Scholars in this field mainly engage in small-scale cooperation. Academic libraries, digital libraries, libraries, information technology and COVID-19 were hot topics during the study period. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a marked increase in research on healthcare. Academic interest in the internet of Things and social media has proliferated recently and may soon attract more attention. Spearman rank correlation analysis shows that research performance (i.e. publication count and citation count) is significantly and positively correlated with social network measurements (i.e. degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality and eigenvector centrality) in studies of Library Hi Tech. Originality/value: This paper reveals a systematic picture of the research landscape of Library Hi Tech and provides a potential guide for future research. The relationship between scientific research performance and social network measurements can be objectively identified based on statistical knowledge. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In recent years, there has been an impressive increase in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical treatment. Studies have explored many topics in the field of medical AI; however, few of them have systematically reviewed the overall area. This chapter retrieves 532 papers on medical AI from Social Sciences Citation Index core database of the Web of Science from 2013 to 2022. Two bibliometric and network analysis tools, including CiteSpace and HistCite, are used to identify the time-and-space knowledge map, research hotspots, emerging trends and key studies of medical AI research. A co-word network of medical AI is constructed to reveal that the field focuses more on the topic of machine learning. The analysis of the burst literature on medical AI indicates the research trends in the sub-sections such as law and ethics. Furthermore, the analysis of the co-citation uncovers the key studies in the field of medical AI. The results of bibliometric analysis illustrate the current situation, past evolution, and future trends in medical AI research, and identify hotspots and future research directions. © 2024 Yonghao Liu and Yu Mu Published under exclusive licence by Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - From the molecular to the cellular to the tissue level, vascular aging is regulated by a complex network involving numerous mechanisms and diseases, and our knowledge of any one level is incomplete and biased. To date, due to the diversity and complexity of the influencing factors, no international standard has been established. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to analyze the global research trends and potential hotspots related to vascular aging. We extracted the relevant publications between January 2003 and December 2023 from the Web of Science Core Collection. VOSviewer and CiteSpace software were used to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze the authors, countries, institutions, and journals in the field of vascular aging. The total number of publications on vascular aging between January 2003 and December 2023 was 1044, showing a steady increase. The United States and the University of Oklahoma published the highest number of research papers in the field. Ungvari Zoltan from the University of Oklahoma was the most productive author (47 papers) on vascular aging, specializing in endothelial cell failure, microcirculation, and aging. Burst detection of keywords revealed that endothelial dysfunction and vascular smooth muscle cells had the highest burst strength, suggesting that these are the current research hot spots in vascular aging research. In conclusion, senescence-associated secretory phenotype, reactive oxygen species, genetic instability, and an imbalance of protein homeostasis, trigger an inflammatory response that affects vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cell function, ultimately leading to vascular aging. This research provides insights into recent advances and preventive strategies in the field of vascular aging. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - To conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of research published on intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) and explore the related frontiers and critical issues concerning it, we searched the Web of Science Core Collection for ICP-related publications from the beginning of 2001 until August of 2023. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were utilized to evaluate the contribution and co-occurrence relationships of various countries and regions, institutes and so on to identify new frontiers and currently exciting topics. Our bibliometric analysis scrutinized 933 articles from 59 countries/regions. China has generated the largest number of publications (31.6% of the total), whereas Germany ranked first when it came to citations per publication. The Imperial College London ranked first with respect to publication output on ICP and betweenness centrality. The Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine was the journal with the highest plurality of papers. Authors such as Williamson, Beuers, Ulrich, and Shao were the most influential. Pregnancy, ursodeoxycholic acid, and ICP were principally noted in publications. Cluster analysis of the references that correlated with the 933 publications showed that they clustered into mortality, ABCB11, BSEP, MRP2, bile acid, and intrahepatic cholestasis. ICP is associated with adverse clinical outcomes for both the mother and fetus. This study provides a critical analysis of the current status and future research trends regarding ICP. It can serve as a useful reference, allowing researchers to conduct in-depth investigations into this promising field.  © 2024 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) in education (AIED) has evolved into a substantial body of literature with diverse perspectives. In this review paper, we seek insights into three critical questions: (1) What are the primary categories of AI applications explored in the education field? (2) What are the predominant research topics and their key findings? (3) What is the status of major research design elements, including guiding theories, methodologies, and research contexts? A bibliometric analysis of 2,223 research articles followed by a content analysis of selected 125 papers reveals a comprehensive conceptual structure of the existing literature. The extant AIED research spans a wide spectrum of applications, encompassing those for adaptive learning and personalized tutoring, intelligent assessment and management, profiling and prediction, and emerging products. Research topics delve into both the technical design of education systems and the examination of the adoption, impacts, and challenges associated with AIED. Furthermore, this review highlights the diverse range of theories applied in the AIED literature, the multidisciplinary nature of publication venues, and underexplored research areas. In sum, this research offers valuable insights for interested scholars to comprehend the current state of AIED research and identify future research opportunities in this dynamic field. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The rising number of immunocompromised people has increased concerns about fungal infections as a severe public health issue. Invasive pulmonary fungal infections (IPFIs) are prevalent and often fatal, particularly for those with weakened immune systems. Understanding IPFIs is crucial. The work aims to offer a concise overview of the field's characteristics, main research areas, development paths, and trends. This study searched the Web of Science Core Collection on June 5, 2024, collecting relevant academic works from 2003 to 2023. Analysis was conducted using CiteSpace, VOSviewer, Bibliometrix Package in R, Microsoft Excel 2019, and Scimago Graphica. The study indicated that the USA, the University of Manchester, and Denning DW led in productivity and impact, while the Journal of Fungi topped the list in terms of publication volume and citations. High-frequency terms include "fungal infection,""invasive,""diagnosis,"and "epidemiology."Keyword and trend analysis identified "influenza,""COVID-19,""invasive pulmonary aspergillosis,"and "metagenomic next-generation sequencing"as emerging research areas. Over the last 2 decades, research on IPFI has surged, with topics becoming more profound. These insights offer key guidance on current trends, gaps, and the trajectory of IPFI studies.  © 2024 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Purpose: We examined the role of technology in employment and work for people with disabilities (PWD). We intended to identify publication trends, key terms, research areas and potential gaps in the topic. Design/methodology/approach: We scrutinized relevant articles from two major databases through bibliometric and systematic review analyses. The bibliometric data involved 256 articles analysed through the VOSviewer software to produce publication trends and network maps. We then scanned article abstracts and selected 114 articles for thematic analysis using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. Findings: The findings revealed a dominance of authors from Western and European countries, particularly the United States of America. Three themes emerged as the crucial factors shaping technology utilization for PWD employment and workplace inclusion. These were identified as individual, environmental and societal, which shed light on the multifaceted influences surrounding PWD’s technology empowerment. Originality/value: The hybrid review approach enables a thorough examination of the published work. Our study proposes a conceptual model for PWD employment and workplace inclusion. Founded on the theories of Work Adjustment, Human–Computer Interaction and the Social Model of Disability. The model provides a clear visualization to guide further research and relevant initiatives in this area. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is a malignant infectious disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV gradually destroys the body's immune system and weakens the body's ability to resist diseases. People living with HIV may have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease than people without HIV. Method: A literature retrieval from January 1, 1993 to October 1, 2023 based on the Web of Science Core Collection database. CiteSpace6.2.R4, VOSviewer v1.6.19, and Microsoft Excel 2019 were utilized for analyzing the following terms: countries, institutions, authors, journals, references, and keywords. Results: There were 1144 articles. The highest number of articles is in the USA, followed by Italy. University of California System, Harvard University, and Johns Hopkins University were the top 3 most productive institutions with publications in this field of research. Journal of Infectious Diseases ranked first with the highest publications (532 records), followed by Immunology (362 records), and Cardiac Cardiovascular Systems (242 records). Keyword co-occurrence analysis showed antiretroviral therapy, myocardial infarction, and protease inhibitors, etc. Keyword cluster analysis obtained 13 categories, which were roughly divided into 3 themes: (1) cardiovascular disease that has occurred or may occur; (2) HIV acquisitions that have occurred; (3) risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Conclusion: The article obtained the hotspots and trends and provided references for subsequent research. Based on the keyword citation burst detection analysis, we speculated that heart failure, risk, subclinical atherosclerosis, infection, and association were the research hotspots in recent years, which had a certain predictive effect on the future research direction. © 2024 the Author(s).

AB  - We analyzed the global disaster resilience research literature to advance understanding of its geographical context. A key objective was to map the variation in disaster research resilience activity to identify hotspots and areas of less activity. The motivation is to reveal regional imbalances in resilience research and collaboration to contribute to the global narrative regarding marginalized regions. The methodology involves an in-depth examination of Web of Science (WoS) bibliographic data from 2010 to 2020, using keywords to develop a comprehensive perspective of disaster resilience research. Additionally, the study incorporates empirical data from the Emergency Events Data (EM-DAT) maintained by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Hazards at the Université Catholique de Louvain (CRED/UCLouvain) to provide context on the impact of disasters. A key innovation of this study is the Disaster Resilience Research Score (DRRS), a quantifiable metric to evaluate the state of disaster resilience research globally by country. The DRRS considers publications, citations, and institutional involvement to provide a well-rounded view of each country's contributions to the field. The results highlight the leading role in disaster resilience research of countries including the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy. However, there is a notable lack of research activity in countries such as Ecuador, Algeria, Kenya, Cambodia, and Myanmar, which also exhibit relatively high vulnerability to environmental hazards. Our findings indicate that countries identified as resilience hotspots predominantly collaborate within their country. This study highlights opportunities for strengthening collaborations between resilience research hotspots and locations less represented in the resilience research literature. It underscores the importance of identifying hot and cold spots to direct future research and foster a more equitable and sustainable response to climate change and hazards. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objective: This study aims to investigate the current status and trends of pressure ulcer care studies over the past two decades using bibliometric and visual analysis, with the objective of providing guidelines for the development of relevant clinical practices or further research. Methods: We conducted a search on the Web of Science Core Collection database using the subject terms “pressure ulcers” or “pressure injuries” for the period from January 2002 to December 2021. Bibliometric tools such as CiteSpace (version 5.8.R3), VOS viewer (version 1.6.17) and the R software 4.0.3 were used to visualize and analyze annual publications, country, institution, author, keyword and cited literature. Results: We identified 5102 publications related to pressure ulcers during the 20-year period, including 4034 articles published in 1557 journals. The number of annual publications on the relevant topics has been increasing annually at an annual growth rate of 4.89 %. The keyword cluster analysis of these studies can be divided into four areas: epidemiology, risk assessment, caring intervention and prognostic analysis. Keyword temporal analysis revealed that the “Braden score” was the most commonly used keyword over a long-term span. The dissemination of knowledge and student training on pressure ulcers have become hot topics of research in recent years. Additionally, pressure ulcer care in COVID-19 patients has emerged as another research hotspot due to the pandemic. Conclusion: Bibliometric analyses have shown that there has been a steady increase in research on pressure ulcer care, with studies related to pressure ulcer risk scores accounting for a large portion of this research. In recent years, education on pressure ulcer-related knowledge and pressure ulcer care in COVID-19 patients have emerged as research hotspots. Future research on pressure ulcer care in the elderly may be a research hotspot as the aging population progresses. © 2024

AB  - Purpose: Environmental communication has been a profession and a subject of study for decades. Communication currently revolves around the anthropogenic ecological catastrophe, which makes the field’s early self-description as a crisis discipline even more pertinent. How communication is used and perceived significantly impacts how human-caused climate disasters and other environmental and social problems develop and how solutions are offered. The phenomenon of technology has shown significant impacts on how people refer to environmental communication. While bibliometric analysis (BA) helps understand the trends, ChatGPT can generate information related to environmental communication. How are they different from each other? What are the limitations? This study aims to identify the trends and limitations of BA and ChatGPT that are associated with environmental communication. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach is used, which refers to BA using the Biblioshiny software (n = 867) and content analysis on ChatGPT 3.5. It uses a systematic technique for keyword search, namely, environmental and communication, from 2000 to 2022. Findings: There has been a decrease in the scientific production of studies starting in 2021 and 2022, which is believed to be due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ChatGPT provides valuable information but is rather complimentary to BA. ChatGPT is unable to provide statistical information related to environmental communication among Scopus-indexed publications. Research limitations/implications: This study focuses on the literature published in Scopus from 2000 to 2022. The keyword is limited to “environmental” and “communication.” Besides, the choice of keywords made it specific to the studies involved in the BA, which may not include some other studies if the keywords are not listed. Originality/value: The originality of the research focuses on the field of environmental communication, its evolution within previous literature and the comparison between BA and the use of ChatGPT for understanding trends and limitations within this field. The text touches upon various aspects, such as the historical context of environmental communication, the impact of technology, the trends in scientific production among Scopus journal papers and the limitations of using ChatGPT compared to BA. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: The interest on short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) regulating the progress of neurological diseases has gained significant attention in recent years. This bibliometric analysis aimed to provide insights into the current state and future trends of global research on SCFAs in neurological research. Methods: To analysis the general trend of publications, the scientific output in this field from 1995 to 2024 was first retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, and PubMed with SCFAs-related and neurological diseases related terms as the subjects. Based on above publication analysis, rapid development stage was marked as 2016 to 2024 and 878 relevant original articles in rapid development stage was retrieved with the time limit from 2016 to 2024. Key bibliometric indicators were calculated and evaluated using CiteSpace with these 878 articles. Results: SCFAs are related to the occurrence and development of neurological diseases. China and the USA have contributed in a significant way to foster a better understanding on SCFAs in neurological diseases. The hot theme of research have gradually shifted from neurodegenerative diseases to psychical diseases. In the aspect of mechanism research, the current hotspot is inflammation. SCFAs are able to modulate oxidative stress and microglia maturation, morphology and function to intervene in the development of neurological diseases and thus SCFAs interventions are promising to treat neurological diseases. 2016 to 2024 is the fast-developing stage in this field. In this stage the publications dramatically increased and were of high quality. Conclusion: SCFAs in neurological research will continue to be an active area in the near future. Future trends might be correlation analysis and neurotherapeutics of SCFAs on patients with psychical diseases and deeper mechanism research is still needed.  © 2024 the Author(s).

AB  - This paper provides a historical overview of research on language teachers' beliefs and emotions, examining how studies on teacher emotions have influenced research on beliefs and classroom practices. Using bibliometric analysis, we mapped trends and paradigms in the literature, focusing on significant developments in this field. Our findings reveal a notable increase in publications on language teacher beliefs, particularly since 2018, indicating growing academic interest. Highly cited studies predominantly emphasize the emotional aspects of teaching, signaling a broader shift in research focus from cognitive to emotional dimensions, commonly referred to as the “emotional turn.” The analysis also identifies influential authors and institutions, with the USA, China, and the UK leading in contributions. Research themes have evolved over time, moving from foundational beliefs and teaching practices to more complex areas like teacher psychology, with particular attention to emotional regulation, identity, and agency in language teaching. Finally, we offer insights for future research, aiming to further explore the intricate relationship between teachers' beliefs and emotions. © 2024

AB  - The concept of a blue economy, as an approach clo-sely related to tourism, has been studied very limi-tedly in the field of tourism despite its importance and existential mission. The existing literature has been discussed mainly conceptually. No study has been found that reveals the details of the studies di-rectly related to the blue economy and tourism and evaluates these studies in general. In this context, this study aims to present a bibliometric overview of the studies on the concept of blue economy in tourism in the Web of Science database. In the study, 74 articles on blue economy in tourism published in the Web of Science (WOS) database between 2015 and 2024 constituted the research sample. As a result of the bibliometric analysis of relevant articles, it was determined that studies on the blue economy ex-perienced a slight growth trend followed by a dec-line. Studies from the United Kingdom, Spain, and the USA were among the most prominent. The most frequently used research method was qualitative re-search, especially document analysis. Although this study is limited to the WOS database, it is obvious that the visibility and citationability of these studies could be much higher. Despite the critical role of coastal and marine tourism in global maritime trade, it has been noted that blue economy and tourism-o-riented studies have not received the recognition they deserve. This is particularly remarkable consi-dering that three-quarters of the Earth’s surface is covered by water and the increasing importance of coastal and marine tourism. © 2024, Ebru Bagci.

AB  - Organizations’ culture and environment create a remarkable influence on the minds ofthe employees. Employees spend a lot of time at the workplace; hence, it is essential to take care of their happiness. Stressful workplace environment reduces the job satisfaction of employees which eventually leads to mental health issues. The study focuses on mapping the publication trends on happiness of employees at their workplace over the years. The mapping was done with the help of Scopus and VOS viewer. The study takesinto consideration the research publication on workplace happiness since 2013 from Scopus database using ‘Employee Happiness at Workplace’ which showed around 104publications related to happiness till Sept 2022. The database was refined and further analyzed by VOS viewer version 1.6.16. Though much research has been done on employee happiness and lot many scales are developed on the happiness index, butbiblio metric analysis is yet to be carried out on workplace happiness, it’s development, forms and factors. This analysis will bridge the gap of researchers and provide them directions to carry on the research for future. © 2024 Kajal Sitlani, Abhineet Saxena, Deepti Sharma and Garima Pancholi.

AB  - The social⁃ecological systems (SES) framework is one of the most widely used methods in the field of social⁃ ecological system research, which analyses the key elements and interactions of social⁃ecological systems and provides solutions for diverse and complex problems through action situation analysis. However, systematic summaries of its development dynamics, research approaches, and application fields are rare in the literature, which is not conducive to more researchers understanding and applying this method, and would also affect its further development. Therefore, this article sorted out and summarized the above issues combined with bibliometric analysis, and discussed the shortcomings of the SES framework research and its improving directions. Firstly, the SES framework has been improving since it was proposed by Ostrom in 2009. Its research has broadly gone through three phases of initial stage, sustained growth, and rapid development. Secondly, the research procedures of the framework can be summarized as focusing on core problems, selecting key variables and evaluating the results. Thirdly, the application fields are focused on three aspects: attribute study, comprehensive management analysis and public policy evaluation. From the existing research, the core problems have covered specific issues of multiple scales and types of social⁃ecological systems; the first⁃level variables focused on Resource Systems, Resource Units, Governance Systems and Actors, while the use frequency of the second⁃level variables varied in each application fields because of the different research focus; the evaluation of system results was mainly based on qualitative analysis, and the introduction of quantitative methods helped to quantify some of the variables. Given to the characteristics of multi⁃disciplinary integration, wide application range and flexible use of variables, the SES framework has strong effectiveness and applicability to social⁃ecological system research. However, there are still some deficiencies in the existing research. The first problem is that SES framework does not clearly present the definition of variables. And the existing studies are weak in analysing the differential characteristics and interaction links of the system across scales and its dynamical evolution patterns. Therefore, future research should focus on the definition, selection and measurement standards of variables, and strengthen spatial⁃temporal research on social⁃ecological system interaction. © 2024 Science Press.

AB  - Background: Lung ischemia-reperfusion injury (LIRI) poses a significant challenge in various clinical scenarios. Despite extensive research on the pathogenesis and potential treatments of LIRI, there is a notable absence of bibliometric analysis. Materials and methods: We summarized the results of LIRI research through two searches on the Web of Science, covering data from 1979 to 2023 with topic words “lung” and “reperfusion injury”. The collected data were analyzed and visualized based on country, author(s), and keywords by bibliometric software. The keyword “programmed cell death” was further added to explore the hotspot of the LIRI research field. Results: The initial analysis of 1648 research articles showed a total of 40 countries and 7031 researchers were involved in the publications, with America being the most productive country in the research field of LIRI. Keyword analysis revealed that the evolving focus of LIRI research has progressively transitioned from, lung transplantation, primary graft dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, and ex vivo lung perfusion to cell death. Subsequently, 212 publications specifically addressing programmed cell death (PCD) in LIRI were identified, which clarified the recent hotspot of the LIRI field. Conclusion: With closer international cooperation and increasing research scale, the LIRI research focused mainly on the pathogenesis and potential therapeutic interventions for LIRI. PCD in LIRI is becoming a trending topic and will continue to be a hotspot in this field. Our study may offer valuable guidance for future research endeavors concerning LIRI. © 2024

AB  - In a changing environment, efficiency and adaptability are essential to improve business competitiveness. The present study analyzed the application of Lean Manufacturing in food production through a review of the scientific literature based in Scopus, using the PRISMA methodology and the Vosviewer and Bibliometrix software. From the bibliometric analysis, there is evidence of an increase in research on Lean Manufacturing in food companies since 2019, with an annual growth rate of 5.96%. Brazil and Peru stand out for their high scientific production, while Brazil and Belgium stand out in terms of citations. In addition, outstanding scientific collaboration between authors from South America and Asia is observed. Three relevant clusters were identified: principles, implementation tools and practical applications of Lean Manufacturing. The thematic mapping highlighted the concepts Cost Reduction, Process Monitoring, Six Sigma and Value Stream Mapping as the most prominent topics underlining the interest and applications in the scientific literature. The implementation of Lean Manufacturing in seven steps is proposed, facilitating the use of agile tools for process optimization and waste reduction in food companies. Lean Manufacturing contributes to improve the flow of products in the supply chain and to the sustainability of small and medium enterprises. Future research should focus on adapting Lean Manufacturing to various contexts and business models in the agri-food sector. © 2024 Universidad Nacional de Trujillo. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Despite numerous studies confirming the association between insulin resistance (IR) and macrophage polarization, there is a lack of bibliometric analysis in this area. Therefore, our objective is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of published literature and identify potential future research trends using bibliometrics. Method: Publications on the topic of macrophage polarization in IR were gathered from the Web of Science Core Collection database (WoSCC) spanning the years 1999–2023. Bibliometric analysis and visualization were conducted using VOSviewers, CiteSpace, the R package “bibliometrix” and Tableau Public. Result: A total of 3435 articles published between 1999 and 2023 were included in the analysis. These articles originated from 75 countries, with the United States and China leading in contributions. The top five research institutions are the University of California, San Diego, Harvard University, the University of Michigan, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and Huazhong University of Science and Technology. In this research domain, Diabetes is the most frequently published journal, and the Journal of Clinical Investigation is the most co-cited. Among the 19,398 authors contributing to these publications, Lumeng CN. not only authored the most papers but also received the highest number of co-citations. “Insulin resistance” emerges as a primary keyword in the analysis of emerging research hotspots. Conclusion: For the first time, bibliometric methods have been employed to conduct a comprehensive summary of papers relevant to macrophage polarization in IR. This study aims to identify the current research direction and future research hotspots, offering valuable guidance and insights for scholars in the field. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - To systematically present an overview of randomized controlled trials on transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) using bibliometric methods, and describe the role and mechanisms of TEAS in most prevalent diseases. Relevant literature was searched in China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, VIP, SinoMed, PubMed, and Web of Science. The literature was imported and screened into NoteExpress, screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, and analyzed using Excel and CiteSpace 6.3R1 software. A total of 1296 documents were included. The number of publications increased annually after 2012. Junlu Wang was the most prolific author. The main research institutions were Peking University, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Shuguang Hospital, and Tongde Hospital of Zhejiang Province. The research hotspots in this field include perioperative care, cancer, pain management, and stroke, primarily focusing on analgesia, immune enhancement, antihypertension, and reduction of gastrointestinal disorders. The main regulatory mechanisms of TEAS include the control of inflammation, oxidative stress, and regulation of the autonomic nervous system. TEAS is most widely used in the elderly, with PC6, ST36, and LI4 being the most frequently studied acupoints in clinical randomized controlled trials. The concept of accelerated rehabilitation is gradually being applied to TEAS, representing an emerging trend for future development. Clinical research on TEAS is rapidly developing, with a focus on applications in cancer and perioperative care. Future research should expand collaboration and conduct high-level clinical and mechanistic studies, which will contribute to the development of standardized protocols and clinical practice.

AB  - Objective To summarize the research progress on Morinda officinalis since 2000 and to predict future research hotspots and trends. Methods Using the bibliometric method of CiteSpace, the research progress on M. officinalis was analyzed to identify research hotspots and trends. Relevant Chinese and English literature on M. officinalis was extracted from the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP, Wanfang, SinoMed, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. After deduplication, CiteSpace and other software were used to statistically analyze the publication volume, authors, institutions, citation frequency, and keywords of the literature in both languages. A total of 2 076 articles were included, comprising 1 636 Chinese articles and 440 English articles. Results A total of 2 076 articles were included in the analysis, among which 1 636 were in Chinese and 440 in English. The visualization analysis results indicate that the annual publication volume related to M. officinalis has shown an overall increasing trend. The journals with the most articles on M. officinalis in Chinese and English were "Chinese Herbal Medicines" and "Molecules, " respectively. The top 10 most cited Chinese and English articles primarily focused on the pharmacological effects of M. officinalis, such as its antidepressant, anti-osteoporotic, and anti-inflammatory properties. The author collaboration network analysis revealed that collaboration among authors was not very close, and the field was mainly studied by domestic scholars. Keyword analysis of Chinese literature showed that the most frequent keyword was "pharmacological effects", and the keyword with the highest centrality was "component analysis." Ten clusters were identified, mainly focusing on pharmacological effects, component analysis, and clinical applications. There were 15 burst terms, with "antidepressant" having the highest burst strength. In the analysis of English literature, "antidepressant" was the keyword with the highest frequency and centrality. Eight clusters were identified, mainly focusing on antidepressant, anti-inflammatory effects, and their mechanisms. There were 17 burst terms, with "anti-inflammatory" having the highest burst strength. Conclusion Current research on M. officinalis involves chemical components, pharmacological effects, drug compatibility, and quality control. Pharmacological effects such as antidepressant and anti-osteoporotic activities may become key focuses of future research. Some pharmacological studies are still in the experimental stage, and the development of corresponding clinical formulations needs further advancement. © 2024 Tianjin Press of Chinese Herbal Medicines.

The main aim of this study was to analyse the unique characteristics of publications centred around MBS for OSAS. We aimed to provide valuable insights into the present status of the field and offer predictions regarding future trends. Design Bibliometric analysis through science mapping and performance analysis methods. Data sources Scientific articles. Data extraction and synthesis A comprehensive search was conducted in the Web of Science database to retrieve publications on MBS for OSAS within the time frame of 1999-2023. The search was performed using keywords such as "Obstructive Sleep Apnea syndrome", "OSAS", "metabolic surgery"and "bariatric surgery"to identify relevant papers. To analyse the bibliometric characteristics of these publications, VOSviewer and R software were used. This analysis encompassed various aspects, including the number of publications, contributions by different countries and institutions, the most cited author, journal publications, citation frequency and the identification of keywords related to popular scientific fields. Results 1264 papers on MBS for OSAS were identified and are currently in a stage of rapid growth. The relevant study involved 1230 institutions from 53 different countries, with the USA topping the field with 465 publications contributed. Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris proved to be the most productive institution, with De Vries N posting the highest number of papers (n=24). The most prolific journal was Obesity Surgery, with 241 publications. Keywords "Bariatric surgery", "Obstructive sleep apnea", "Obesity", "Weight loss"and "Morbid obesity"have the highest frequency of occurrence. Conclusions The relationship between obesity and OSAS, various metabolic surgical techniques, and the mechanism of MBS for OSAS will continue to be related areas of frontiers. Furthermore, while there has been a gradual increase in basic research, the mechanisms involved and the long-term efficacy of bariatric MBS for OSAS still require further investigation. It is anticipated that these research areas may emerge as potential hot topics in the future.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

AB  - Abstract: The strong increase in global demand for lithium, driven by the ion battery market and the use of this non-metallic mineral in various economic sectors such as mining (as a non-metallic and non-renewable mineral), health, technology, and geopolitical issues, has fueled the development of disruptive innovation, with new products linked to knowledge creation. These developments have included, among other things, the use of new processing techniques, the creation of new high-capacity cathode materials, the investigation of new sources of lithium, and increased recycling of lithium-ion batteries. This article's primary goal is to assess how this knowledge gap is related with innovation issues using the analysis of the scholar as a case study. Additionally, the examination of public policy related to the lithium business will be continued and updated in this publication. This study uses computerized bibliometric analysis based on the R program and Biblioshiny, a web interface for Bibliometrix analysis. One of the earliest studies to examine the discrepancy between lithium production and consumption based on innovation is this one. The research's contribution is to highlight the disparities and gaps in knowledge generation between producer and consumer countries, which creates a great opportunity to develop better public policies that use existing knowledge and promote collaborations between mining and technology companies for the development of a more sustainable, efficient, effective and competitive industry with future societies. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Bladder cancer (BC) is a significant global health issue with high incidence and mortality rates. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and have been found to be dysregulated in BC. Understanding the role of miRNAs in BC development could lead to targeted therapies and improved patient management. Our study presents a thorough examination of the correlation between BC and miRNA research from 2008 to 2022. With the help of 3 powerful methods, including VOSviewer, Biblioshiny, and CiteSpace software, we analyzed the retrieved documents from “Core Collection databases online” on the Web of Science. In total, 798 articles were extracted from the Web of Science, and the number of published papers showed an upward trend from 2008 to 2019. The total number of citations was 21,233, of which the highest paper was a review article written by Chan Jiajia et al in 2018 with 752 citations. Based on the result of the coauthor analysis, Seki Naohiko was the most productive writer and China had the highest volume of published articles. Co-citation analysis was used to reveal the knowledge structure of the research field. In addition to the key word “Bladder cancer” and “miRNA,” “Proliferation,” “Biomarkers,” and “Apoptosis” were the high-frequency used keyword. Recently, increasingly researchers have paid more attention to the field about BC and miRNA around the worldwide. Through in-depth communication and close collaboration, the veil of miRNA in BC has gradually been unveiled. Bibliometric analysis helps to identify hotspots in research and areas for future investigation. Abbreviations: BC = bladder cancer, EMT = epithelial–mesenchymal transition, miRNA = microRNA, NMIBC = non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer TLS = total link strength WOS = Web of Science.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to critically review the research on food eco-labels to identify research gaps and recommend future research directions in business and management. Design/methodology/approach: A hybrid integrated review combines bibliometric analysis with an in-depth framework-based study of theory–context–characteristics–methodology (TCCM) and reviews quality research published over 21 years between 2002 and 2022. Findings: We identify key research themes and the knowledge structure of food eco-label research. Future researchers should explore food eco-label dynamics and phenomena in areas related to consumer behaviour, information, consumer knowledge, environmental concerns, trust, packaging and willingness-to-pay as antecedent factors. Research limitations/implications: This review contributes to the business and management literature by quantifying existing research and consolidating its evolution. The articles were sourced from the established Web of Science (WoS) database. Other databases should be included in future reviews. We also focus on research published in business and management. Further studies could include research beyond such specialised domains. Practical implications: Consumers need more information on the objectives and meaning of food eco-labels. The dissemination of knowledge on eco-labels, as well as effective communication and information on eco-labels, are relevant to future research issues. Social implications: The knowledge derived from this research holds significant potential in shaping policies and devising tools aimed at reducing the carbon footprint linked to food production and consumption. Considering the substantial impact of these activities on our planet’s carbon footprint, addressing food security and sustainability emerges as a crucial concern for humanity. Recognising the importance of eco-label communication and information becomes particularly pertinent for future generations, who stand to bear the most substantial impact of climate change and sustainable development. These generations are also more inclined toward embracing and implementing sustainable practices. Originality/value: There are no comprehensive, integrated reviews exploring the methods, variables and constructs used in studies on food eco-labels based on all articles published in WoS journals in the business and management domains. This is the first comprehensive literature review using a hybrid approach (bibliometric review with TCCM framework) in the field of food eco-label research. © 2024, Valeska V.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to comprehend how AI aids marketers in engaging customers and generating value for the company by way of customer engagement (CE). CE is a popular area of research for scholars and practitioners. One area of research that could have far-reaching ramifications with regard to strengthening CE is artificial intelligence (AI). Consequently, it becomes extremely important to understand how AI is helping the marketer reach customers and create value for the firm via CE. Design/methodology/approach: A detailed approach using both systematic review and bibliometric analysis was used. It involved identifying key research areas, the most influential authors, studies, journals, countries and organisations. Then, a comprehensive analysis of 50 papers was carried out in the four identified clusters through co-citation analysis. Furthermore, a content analysis of 42 articles for the past six years was also conducted. Findings: Emerging themes explored through cluster analysis are CE concepts and value creation, social media strategies, big data innovation and significance of AI in tertiary industry. Identified themes for content analysis are CE conceptualisation, CE behaviour in social media, CE role in value co-creation and CE via AI. Research limitations/implications: CE has emerged as a topic of great interest for marketers in recent years. With the rapid growth of digital media and the spread of social media, firms are now embarking on new online strategies to promote CE (Javornik and Mandelli, 2012). In this review, the authors have thoroughly assessed multiple facets of prior research papers focused on the utilisation of AI in the context of CE. The existing research papers highlighted that AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants offer real-time interaction capabilities, swiftly addressing inquiries, delivering assistance and navigating customers through their experiences (Cheng and Jiang, 2022; Naqvi et al., 2023). This rapid and responsive engagement serves to enrich the customer’s overall interaction with the business. Consequently, this research can contribute to a comprehensive knowledge of how AI is assisting marketers to reach customers and create value for the firm via CE. This study also sheds light on both the attitudinal and behavioural aspects of CE on social media. While existing CE literature highlights the motivating factors driving engagement, the study underscores the significance of behavioural engagement in enhancing firm performance. It emphasises the need for researchers to understand the intricate dynamics of engagement in the context of hedonic products compared to utilitarian ones (Wongkitrungrueng and Assarut, 2020). CEs on social media assist firms in using their customers as advocates and value co-creators (Prahalad and Ramaswamy, 2004; Sawhney et al., 2005). A few of the CE themes are conceptual in nature; hence, there is an opportunity for scholarly research in CE to examine the ways in which AI-driven platforms can effectively gather customer insights. As per the prior relationship marketing studies, it is evident that building relationships reduces customer uncertainty (Barari et al., 2020). Therefore, by using data analysis, businesses can extract valuable insights into customer preferences and behaviour, equipping them to engage with customers more effectively. Practical implications: The rapid growth of social media has enabled individuals to articulate their thoughts, opinions and emotions related to a brand, which creates a large amount of data for VCC. Meanwhile, AI has emerged as a radical way of providing value content to users. It expands on a broader concept of how software and algorithms work like human beings. Data collected from customer interactions are a major prerequisite for efficiently using AI for enhancing CE. AI not only reduces error rates but, at the same time, helps human beings in decision-making during complex situations. Owing to built-in algorithms that analyse large amounts of data, companies can inspect areas that require improvement in real time. Time and resources can also be saved by automating tasks contingent on customer responses and insights. AI enables the analysis of customer data to create highly personalised experiences. It can also forecast customer behaviour and trends, helping businesses anticipate needs and preferences. This enables proactive CE strategies, such as targeted offers or timely outreach. Furthermore, AI tools can analyse customer feedback and sentiment across various channels. This feedback can be used to make necessary improvements and address concerns promptly, ultimately fostering stronger customer relationships. AI can facilitate seamless engagement across multiple digital channels, ensuring that customers can interact with a brand through their preferred means, be it social media, email, or chat. Consequently, this research proposes that practitioners and companies can use analysis performed by AI-enabled systems on CEB, which can assist companies in exploring the extent to which each product influences CE. Understanding the importance of these attributes would assist companies in developing more memorable CE features. Originality/value: This study examines how prominent CE and AI are in academic research on social media by identifying research gaps and future developments. This research provides an overview of CE research and will assist academicians, regulators and policymakers in identifying the important topics that require investigation. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Objectives: To conduct the first bibliometric analysis of retinoblastoma research in Türkiye and identify leading institutions, authors, collaboration patterns, and potential growth areas. Materials and Methods: We conducted a search on international databases (Web of Science [WoS] and Scopus), a national database (TR Dizin), and gray literature sources (thesis/Scientific and Technological Research Council of Türkiye project reports). Data were cleaned and analyzed using bibliometric tools, including Open Refine and VOSviewer. Bibliometric indicators such as number of publications, journals, h-index, collaboration patterns, and co-occurrence of keywords were examined. Results: A search of WoS and Scopus entries published between 1966 and 2024 yielded 122 relevant publications, with articles (n=78, 63.9%) being the most common document type. More than two-thirds of the publications were from 4 institutions: İstanbul University (n=48, 23.8%), Hacettepe University (n=34, 16.8%), Ankara University (n=33, 16.3%), and İstanbul University-Cerrahpaşa (n=22, 10.9%). The total number of citations was 1,148, with an average of 10.16 per publication and an h-index of 16. Excluding 8 internationally collaborated articles, the citations and h-index decreased to 661 and 14, respectively. Pediatric Blood & Cancer was the most preferred journal, with 22 publications (19.5%). The national database search yielded 18 publications with 0 citations. Of 29 relevant theses, only 4 (13.8%) were published. The estimated publication growth predicted an increase in publication numbers per year until 2030. Conclusion: This study represents the first bibliometric analysis of retinoblastoma research conducted in Türkiye. Our findings underscore the concentration of research in a few institutions, the importance of international collaborations, and the potential for growth in particular areas. Addressing these areas strategically can empower Turkish researchers to enhance their contributions to the field and improve patient care. ©Copyright 2024 by the Turkish Ophthalmological Association / Turkish Journal of Ophthalmology published by Galenos Publishing House.

AB  - Purpose: It is unclear whether regional rather than global or discipline-focussed preprint platforms as an innovation in the communication of science are removing any of the barriers faced by researchers in the scientific periphery or whether they are increasing access to and visibility of science from the periphery. In response, this paper focusses on the uptake, visibility and academic impact of regional preprint publishing platforms in two peripheral regions (Africa and Latin America) to gain insights into the use and possible impact of regional preprint servers. Design/methodology/approach: Comparative quantitative analysis using bibliometric and altmetric data to compare six preprint servers (two regional, one global and three discipline-specific). Findings: There is evidence of the uptake of regional preprint servers, but the uptake is comparatively modest compared with global and discipline-focussed preprint servers. The academic and social visibility of preprints available on regional preprint servers is comparatively lower when compared to other preprint servers. The preprint server SciELO preprint in comparison to AfricArxiv shows signs of increasing growth and visibility, but more time is required to reach any definitive conclusions. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited by the short timeframe that the regional preprint servers have existed compared to some of the other preprint servers. The absence of reliable data on the research populations by region or globally by discipline places limits on the comparability of the raw data. Originality/value: The article provides for the first time a detailed empirical analysis of the contribution of preprint servers targeted at researchers from the scientific periphery to global science.

AB  - This study investigates the coevolution of coauthorship and citation networks and their influence on scientific metrics such as the h-index and journal impact factors. Using a preferential attachment mechanism, we developed a model that integrated these networks and validated it with data from the American Physical Society (APS). While the correlations between reference counts, paper lifetime, and team sizes with scientific impact metrics are well-known, our findings demonstrate how these relationships vary depending on specific model parameters. For instance, increasing reference counts or reducing paper lifetime significantly boosts both journal impact factors and h-indexes, while expanding team sizes without adding new authors can artificially inflate h-indexes. These results highlight potential vulnerabilities in commonly used metrics and emphasize the value of modeling and simulation for improving bibliometric evaluations. © 2024 by the author.

AB  - This article investigates the relationship between Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4), academic integrity as its part, and artificial intelligence (AI) through a bibliometric analysis, assessing whether this intersection represents a clash or win-win cooperation. SDG 4 aims to ensure equitable access to quality education, while AI technologies have the potential to enhance educational practices but demote academic integrity. By analyzing a comprehensive body of the literature, this study identifies key trends and thematic areas where AI is applied in educational settings, particularly concerning maintaining academic integrity. The findings reveal a growing body of research highlighting AI’s role in personalizing learning experiences, improving educational accessibility, and supporting educators’ teaching methodologies. However, challenges such as ethical considerations, data privacy, and the digital divide are also addressed, indicating potential conflicts that need to be navigated. Ultimately, this analysis suggests that while there are significant opportunities for synergy between AI and SDG 4, the management of careful implementation and policy frameworks is essential to ensure that AI serves as a tool for promoting inclusive and sustainable education rather than exacerbating existing inequalities. AI transforms science management by enhancing data analysis, streamlining research processes, and improving decision-making, ultimately leading to more efficient and effective scientific research and innovation. The findings reveal that while AI can facilitate personalized learning and enhance educational accessibility, it also poses challenges related to academic misconduct, such as plagiarism and the misuse of AI-generated content. This duality highlights the need for educational institutions to develop robust frameworks that leverage AI’s capabilities while safeguarding academic integrity. The article concludes that a collaborative approach, integrating AI into educational practices with a strong emphasis on ethical considerations and integrity, can lead to a synergistic relationship that supports the goals of SDG 4. Recommendations for future research and practical implications for managers, educators, scientists, and policymakers are also discussed, emphasizing the importance of fostering an educational environment that embraces innovation while upholding ethical standards. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Managing the fragmented nature of information generated on construction sites and firms is the need of the hour. Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) are the most prevalent information systems (ISs) used in the construction industry, with varied capabilities but also with significant overlap. It is essential to analyze the current state of Common Data Environments (CDEs) that support both BIM and ERP as separate systems, as well as those that facilitate their integration. This analysis will ultimately help establish a practical framework for implementing this integration, enabling smoother information flow and enhanced utilization in construction projects. This paper presents a bibliometric analysis and provides a global perspective on research developments in the field of construction ERP and its integrations with BIM. It consolidates publication data from various databases (e.g., Scopus and Web of Science) as per geographical spread, authors, and number of publications as per the keyword search. It observes key research themes in each phase of the analysis. This paper concludes that although the existing literature has established the benefits of BIM and ERP integration, research is still in its nascent stage and identifies research gaps that can be taken up for further research. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The “Metaverse” is evaluated as having significant potential in a “Smart city” design and operation. Despite growing interest, there is still a lack of comprehensive quantitative analysis on the “Metaverse”, particularly in the context of smart cities. This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of 604 articles selected from the “WoS” database and employs three dimensions of technology, people, and institutions as a balanced perspective on smart cities, providing a comprehensive understanding of research trends on the “Metaverse” in the context of smart cities. This study identifies the “Metaverse” as a Virtual reality technology, popular since 2021, and provides information on the active years, countries, fields, journals, authors, and institutions involved in “Metaverse” research on smart cities. This study also identifies three stages of research development as follows: Stage 1 (2007–2013) to Stage 2 (2014–2020) and Stage 3 (2021–20 October 2023), revealing the research focus evolution from basic “urban planning” to complex “urban governance” and “Smart city” construction with consideration of multi-stakeholders’ perspectives. Additionally, this study reveals that “Metaverse” research studies on the “technology” dimension have consistently outnumbered that on “institutions” and “people” across all stages in the “Smart city” domain. These findings address current theoretical gaps and offer a foundation for future research. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Worldwide, cancer ranks among the foremost contributors to mortality despite recent medical progress. Alternative approaches in controlling various forms of cancer are being highly explored by researchers. This study provides the global research trends in the utilization of medicinal plant-synthesized nanoparticles for cancer treatment over the span of 18 years using scientometric analysis. Recent research advances on medicinal plant-derived nanoparticles for cancer treatment and their possible mechanisms of action were described. Relevant articles published between 2005 and 2023 were retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science and analyzed using RStudio and VOSViewer. Scientometric indicators were employed to analyze the results. The initial search returned 5695 articles, with a publication growth rate of 3.71% annually. Countries from Asia contributed the most (61.37%) to the total number of publications. The therapeutic effects of nanoparticles derived from medicinal plants can be attributed to various mechanistic pathways, including induced apoptosis from reactive oxygen species generation, as well as mitochondrial and cell membrane disruption, amongst others. Although some reported studies demonstrated promising safety and efficacy against certain cancer cells in vivo and in vitro, the little to no clinical data on medicinal plant-synthesized nanoparticles hinder the ability to make informed decisions about their clinical potential in cancer treatment. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This study examines the scientific production focused on the Maximum Principle between 1962 and 2021. Results indicate a consistent increase in the absolute number of publications over time. In relative terms, there is a resurgence of interest in this research field after the period between 2004 and 2009. Overall, these findings support the idea of strategic complementarity between the Maximum Principle and optimal control. However, there is a notable exception during the period 2010–2015, characterised by a decline in scientific production focused on the Maximum Principle and a simultaneous increase in focus on optimal control. Academic journals that play a role in promoting this research field tend to have high impact factors and interesting cite scores. Using a modified Boston Consulting Group matrix, the results reveal the persistence of two researchers labelled as stars and three as cash cows. A multiple linear regression analysis confirms that reputation significantly influences the clustering trends. A critical discussion is provided to highlight the dichotomy between popularity and effective contributions in this research field. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Circular economy (CE) research has advanced significantly in recent years in areas like environmental science, engineering, and technology. Governance presents CE strategies as imperative and compelling, often linked to efforts to achieve sustainable business development. However, the financial quantification of a CE is still underexplored and heterogeneous, with multiple research streams exploring the financial dimension. The aims of this study are twofold: (i) to analyze the productivity of the scientific literature and the conceptual evolution of circularity as it relates to financial strategies; and (ii) to formulate future research directions addressing a CE in close connection with financial sustainability knowledge. Bilbiometrix R-package 2023.12.1 and VOSviewer version 1.6.20 were used to analyze a sample of 279 articles retrieved from WoS and Scopus using the PRISMA protocol. The analysis covered the period 2010–2023, with the diachronic thematic analysis revealing four key themes: (1) CE and green financial performance; (2) environmental impact of CE; (3) performance approach of CE and metrics; (4) CE and sustainable development. Building on previous knowledge, we developed an integrated and multidisciplinary framework of CE embedded in financial performance. Future research agenda shaped by the emerging themes and research gaps can support managers, shareholders, or governance in incorporating CE policies into operational activities and strengthening sustainable circularity knowledge. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Aerosol and aerosol-cloud radiation interactions significantly influence Earth’s radiative balance, hydrological cycle, global monsoons, atmospheric circulation, and climate, attracting substantial scientific attention. This study employs bibliometric and quantitative trend analyses to evaluate the development, knowledge structure, and research trends in aerosol and aerosol-cloud radiation interactions from 1999 to 2023 using Web of Science Core Collection data. Results reveal a consistent increase in publications and citations, indicating sustained attention in this field. The USA and China are identified as the most prolific countries, with significant contributions from institutions like the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. However, while the USA shows a recent decline in growth, China has demonstrated a significant upward trend in research contributions. Productive journals include Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics and the Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres, with prolific authors such as Babu S. Suresh and Li Zhanqing. A co-occurrence analysis of keywords identifies research topics focused on aerosol optical properties, aerosol types, aerosol radiation interactions, and aerosol-cloud interactions. Emerging trends emphasize advanced methodologies such as remote sensing, model simulation, and artificial intelligence, with growing attention to regions like the Southern Ocean and the Arctic. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights for researchers, identifying knowledge gaps and guiding future research directions in aerosol and aerosol-cloud radiation interactions, which are crucial for understanding their climatic and atmospheric impacts. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Contrary to the widely accepted adage ‘do not engage in business activities with relatives’, individuals from Chinese, Indian, and Pakistani backgrounds are achieving significant progress, while individual groups experience stagnation. While prior research offers substantial insights into the relationship between kinship and entrepreneurial ventures, there exists a paucity of information regarding the mechanisms through which certain kin individuals attain success while others do not. The principal inquiries revolve around the question, ‘In what ways do kinship networks contribute to entrepreneurial success?’ Furthermore, within a multicultural and heterogeneous framework, how might kinship networks serve as essential resources that promote entrepreneurial development, or do they instead pose additional challenges to such advancement? To address these inquiries, this study conducts an integrative review of entrepreneurship through the conceptual framework of kinship (kin-entrepreneurship), a notion distinctly from emerging disciplines. The contextual backdrop of this study is firmly anchored in the rising incidence of business failures and their resultant ramifications for sustainable economic development on a global scale. By employing an integrative review methodology that encompasses both bibliometric and content analyses of extant literature, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines, this research elucidates the fundamental components relevant to kin-entrepreneurship. In tackling this issue, the present investigation explores the trends, trajectories, and potential futures concerning the nexus of kinship and entrepreneurship. A bibliometric analysis was conducted on a dataset comprising 292 scholarly articles focused on kin-entrepreneurship, published between 1980 and 2023, sourced from the Scopus and Web of Science databases. Significant findings highlight “kinship-based business influencers” and “entrepreneurial environment and consequences”, as crucial themes. Subsequent to the discovery of the themes, this paper advocates for a paradigm shift from a narrow familial perspective on business to a more expansive kinship viewpoint, which can enhance comprehension of the complex dynamics within business environments where kinship-based business influencers are multifaceted, affecting economic performance (where entrepreneurs capitalize on these affiliations for economic advantage), decision-making (which improves business sustainability through resource allocation among kin), and employee relations (as kin connections foster both formal and informal employment opportunities) for entrepreneurs. Consequently, this study posits that kinship-oriented business dynamics play a crucial role in influencing entrepreneurial decision-making by offering social capital, resources, and strategic guidance, which are essential for mitigating existing entrepreneurial attrition rates and, in turn, are fundamental for fostering economic development. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Cultivated land is the most important natural resource for human survival and development. The quality of cultivated land is closely related to grain output, and whether it can guarantee stable food supply is directly related to national food security. Cultivated land quality evaluation is an effective tool for understanding and mastering cultivated land quality. However, few studies have applied bibliometrics to quantitatively and systematically analyze this field. We used VOSviewer 1.6.19 and CiteSpace 6.3.1 software to visually analyze and construct 2478 documents related to cultivated land quality evaluation retrieved from the Web of Science core collection database from 2000 to 2023. Results show that cultivated land quality evaluation is still a popular research field. The collaboration ability among authors is weak and the distribution of institutions and countries publishing in this field is very uneven. In addition, the relevant research has been published in a variety of journals such as agriculture, environment, ecology, and computer technology. The research content is becoming more and more interdisciplinary. Keywords such as “Soil quality”, “Swat”, “Remote sensing”, “Heavy metals” and “Ecosystem services” have become hot topics in this field. In the future, it is necessary to further deepen the connotation of cultivated land quality, develop a long time series dynamic model of cultivated land quality evaluation and monitoring, and enhance the transformation of research results into practical applications. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Distributed Computing Systems (DCS) is transforming business models across industries. IoT devices allow immediate monitoring of equipment and processes, mitigating lost time and enhancing efficiency. In this case, manufacturing companies use IoT sensors to monitor machinery, predict failures, and schedule maintenance. Also, automation via IoT reduces manual intervention, resulting in boosted productivity in smart factories and automated supply chains. IoT devices generate this vast amount of data, which businesses analyze to gain insights into customer behavior, operational inefficiencies, and market trends. In turn, Distributed Computing Systems process this data, providing actionable insights and enabling advanced analytics and machine learning for future trend predictions. While, IoT facilitates personalized products and services by collecting data on customer preferences and usage patterns, enhancing satisfaction and loyalty, IoT devices support new customer interactions, like wearable health devices, and enable subscription-based and pay-per-use models in transportation and utilities. Conversely, real-time monitoring enhances security, as distributed systems quickly respond to threats, ensuring operational safety. It also aids regulatory compliance by providing accurate operational data. In this way, this study, through a Bibliometric Literature Review (LRSB) of 91 screened pieces of literature, aims at ascertaining to what extent the aforementioned capacities, overall, enhance business models, in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. The study concludes that those systems altogether leverage businesses, promoting competitive edge, continuous innovation, and adaptability to market dynamics. In particular, overall, the integration of both IoT and Distributed Systems in business models augments its numerous advantages: it develops smart infrastructures e.g., smart grids; edge computing that allows data processing closer to the data source e.g., autonomous vehicles; predictive analytics, by helping businesses anticipate issues e.g., to foresee equipment failures; personalized services e.g., through e-commerce platforms of personalized recommendations to users; enhanced security, while reducing the risk of centralized attacks e.g., blockchain technology, in how IoT and Distributed Computing Systems altogether impact business models. Future research avenues are suggested. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Diabetes is a metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia due to impaired insulin secretion, activity, or both. Carbohydrate counting, known for optimal metabolic control, plays in the therapeutic strategy in diabetes. In the last decade, an increasing amount of research has been conducted on carbohydrate counting, and the literature on this topic has been published in academic journals. This bibliometric analysis aimed to comprehensively review and analyze publications from this period, shedding light on trends, developments, and key contributors. The Expanded Science Citation Index published by the Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science, which covers English-language articles published from 1993 to 2024, was used. We selected “carbohydrate counting”, “carbohydrate count”, “carbohydrate counts”, “carbohydrate counts”, and similar words as “TOPIC” to search for related articles. All basic information about each article were collected, including authors, countries, citations, and keywords. The findings emphasized the need for continued research in this area and to learn more about studies showing the relationship between carbohydrate counting and the pathophysiology of diabetes, treatment, complications, and technologies. This analysis summarizes the general trends and key findings of research on carbohydrate counting over the past years and provides guidance for future research. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Urban ecosystems, and the services they provide, are a key focus of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, specifically SDG 11, which emphasizes making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Green infrastructure (GI) is crucial in enhancing citizens’ quality of life and achieving this goal and it can be defined as a strategically planned network of natural and semi-natural areas designed to deliver a range of ecosystem services (ESs). These infrastructures improve ecosystem functioning, protect biodiversity, promote health, support sustainable land and water management, and boost the local green economy. This paper explores the scientific literature on GI and their ESs in cities using bibliometric science. By combining the keywords “Green Infrastructures”, “Ecosystem Services”, and “Cities” with VOSviewer software (1.6.20 version), we analyzed trends over time. Results show growing attention to these topics, emphasizing human well-being, urban resilience, and sustainability. The study also highlights that focusing exclusively on either “Green Infrastructure in Cities” or “Ecosystem Services in Cities” leads to fragmented insights. A more integrated examination of these three domains offers a holistic view and underscores the importance of considering ecosystem disservices. The study further identifies key research directions, including the need for a comprehensive evaluation of diverse GI types, especially those that are under-researched, such as green roofs, sports areas, and wetlands, and the underexplored role of cultural ecosystem services. Additionally, future research should consider both the benefits and disservices of GI to support better urban planning decisions. Finally, integrating biophysical, social, and economic values of ESs is critical for providing more holistic insights and enhancing sustainable urban development. The novelty of this paper lies in its integrated, holistic approach to examining GI and ESs in urban areas, with a focus on ecosystem disservices, insufficient attention to specific GI types, and the role of cultural ecosystem services—each contributing to the creation of more resilient and sustainable cities. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Land degradation poses a significant global challenge, adversely affecting soil quality and diminishing the productivity of arable land, which, in turn, impacts food production and ecosystem services. This degradation manifests in various forms, including soil compaction, salinity, nutrient depletion, loss of biodiversity, and contamination, ultimately rendering soil unproductive and exacerbating climate change. Given the challenges arising from conventional farming practices and climate change, there is an urgent necessity to develop agricultural systems that not only enhance agronomic efficiency but also improve environmental performance. This study focuses on addressing food security in Africa by investigating the role of land restoration and biodiversity in sustainable food systems through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis for documents between 2010 to 2023, identifying 64 relevant documents. The analysis reveals insights into the most-cited documents and thematic evolution, underscoring the significant contributions from Ethiopia and advocating for collaborative efforts among African nations. Key themes identified include “climate change”, “food security”, “biodiversity conservation”, and “agroecosystems”, all highlighting the importance of sustainable agricultural practices. The study anticipates a continued prioritization of agroecosystems, smart agriculture, and biodiversity conservation to tackle food security challenges in the face of climate change. Collaboration, investment in research, and practical initiatives emerge as essential components for achieving sustainable food security and mitigating climate change impacts in Africa. This research provides valuable insights into the current landscape and future trends regarding the contributions of land restoration and biodiversity to food systems in Africa, emphasizing the critical need for concerted efforts to address these pressing issues. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - With the increasing pollution caused by plastic products, people’s awareness of environmental protection has gradually increased. Based on the advantages of China’s bamboo resources and bamboo industry, the International Network for Bamboo and Rattan launched the ‘Utilizing bamboo as a sustainable alternative to plastic’ initiative in November 2022 to accelerate the implementation of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This initiative provides a nature-based solution for global sustainable development, which will have a profound impact on promoting global green development, industrial science and technology, social services, cultural exchanges, and other fields. It has a huge market capacity and application potential. This study aims to understand the research status, hotspots, development trends, and prospects of this initiative. WoS and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were searched for the relevant literature on ‘utilizing bamboo as a sustainable alternative to plastic bamboo as plastic’ and ‘bamboo resources’ from the establishment of the database to 2024. Bibliometric methods and VOSviewer were used to analyze 1855 literatures with the above two keywords published in the Web of Science core set database from 2000 to 2024. A visual analysis was performed on the number of publications, national research institutions, researchers, number of citations, and research topics of the literature. For example, China, the United States, and India ranked in the top three in terms of the number of articles published, with 1103, 267, and 167, respectively. China had the highest number of citations, reaching 26,607. At the same time, the literature with ‘bamboo’ as the keyword in CNKI was analyzed to understand the species of bamboo currently studied. A literature investigation was carried out around the resource cultivation of the bamboo industry in our country, and it was found that the research on ‘use bamboo as plastic’ and ‘bamboo resources’ had been valued by scholars at home and abroad, and had formed a relatively stable research group. Using scientific and technological innovation to improve the product quality of ‘bamboo instead of plastic’, expanding its application scope and market demand, and realizeing the sustainable industry development of ‘bamboo instead of plastic’ is the current research hotspot and the future development direction. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Opuntia spp. (forage cactus or spineless cactus) is a plant native to Mexico that is commonly used as alternative nutrient-rich fodder in semi-arid regions. Due to its resistance to drought, forage cactus has become an important least-cost ingredient for formulating balanced rations for ruminants during times of scarcity. In addition, ensiling, an anaerobic fermentation process, is also a strategy used to allow a supply of bulky food all year round, since it conserves forage and maintains its nutritional value. In this sense, using the Scopus database and the visualization tool VOSviewer, the present work proposes a bibliometric analysis of forage cactus silage to track and map the evolution and main issues in the research field, current trends, and future directions. The results revealed that the first publication was in 2013; and since 2020, the number of publications has been growing. Brazil was highlighted, by far, as the most relevant country on the topic, and the top institutions were from northeast Brazil, which has been working on co-authored articles. The current hot research topics are focusing on the mixed silage of forage cactus and other forages such as gliricidia, maniçoba, and sorghum biomass, as well as evaluating the fermentative performance and chemical characteristics for improving ruminal diets, especially for goats and sheep. This study provides important information for researchers to identify gaps and direct their studies to better use the whole potential of forage cactus as an alternative roughage source. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This study uses the Scopus and Web of Science databases to review quantitative methods to forecast electricity consumption from 2015 to 2024. Using the PRISMA approach, 175 relevant publications were identified from an initial set of 821 documents and subsequently subjected to bibliometric analysis. This analysis examined publication trends, citation metrics, and collaboration patterns across various countries and institutions. Over the period analyzed, the number of articles has steadily increased, with a more rapid rise observed after 2020. Although China dominates this research field, strong bibliographic coupling worldwide indicates significant international collaboration. The study suggests that no single method consistently outperforms others across all contexts and that forecasting methods should be adapted to regional contexts, considering specific economic, social, and environmental factors. Furthermore, we emphasize that review papers should compare methods and results regarding both time horizon and temporal resolution, as these aspects are crucial for the accuracy and applicability of the forecasts. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Stable isotope techniques have become a critical tool for tracking mine water and identifying its contamination. In order to explore in depth the research hotspots and trends in stable isotope technology in the study of mine water and the environmental pollution it induces, the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database of the relevant literature in this field from 1998 to 2023 was used for visual bibliometric analysis by applying CiteSpace software (version 5.7R5). The results showed that the periodical literature in this field shows a fluctuating upward trend. In the cooperation network of country and institution, the centrality of the United States was as high as 0.74 and 0.23, much higher than that of other countries, which means that in terms of the institutions, the number of publications, and the status of research, the United States is ahead of other countries. China’s research started later than the United States’s but is developing rapidly. Although its importance and influence in this research field are only slightly lower than those of the United States, China still needs to improve its cooperation with other countries and regions. The research hotspots in this area center around identifying and understanding pollution processes, studying mine water sources and mixing, exploring the evolution of water chemistry and its isotopic composition, and investigating the environmental impacts of mine water. Innovative isotope-tracing methods and techniques, isotope fractionation mechanisms, sources of sulfate, and their impact on the water environment will remain the focus of the forthcoming research phase. This study uses bibliometrics to systematically summarize the research hotspots and trends in stable isotope techniques in mine water problems in terms of their footprint in the academic literature, which is of great significance for the utilization of water resources in mine drainage and pollution control in mines. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - (1) Background: This study aimed to quantify and evaluate the publication rate and discrepancies of functional urology abstracts from international conferences, and to explore the interdisciplinary contributions of urology and gynecology to the field. (2) Methods: A retrospective bibliometric and content analysis was conducted on abstracts presented between 2015 and 2019 at the EAU and ICS congresses, focusing on functional-urological keywords. A discrepancy scoring system ranging from 0 (minor discrepancies) to 3 (significant discrepancies) assessed the consistency between conference abstracts and full-text publications, and an in-depth analysis determined the disciplinary origin of these publications. (3) Results: Between 2015 and 2019, 53% of EAU and 57% of ICS congress abstracts were published as full-text articles, with minor discrepancies in 38% of EAU and 49% of ICS publications, and significant discrepancies in 17% from both. Urology departments dominated publications, contributing 68% at EAU and 55% at ICS, whereas gynecology contributed only 1% at EAU and 12% at ICS. (4) Conclusions: This study illuminates the need for improved reporting standards and interdisciplinary collaboration in functional urology, as well as increased gynecology research in functional urology-related fields, suggesting that addressing these issues is crucial for advancing the field and enhancing patient care. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The release of scientific research has substantial consequences for both the research and the institution in which it was carried out. The selection of publishing methods for scientific articles, such as journal type, quartile, indexed databases, and publishing models, plays a crucial role. Various publishing models exist, including platinum, gold, and green open access. In this study, we examine the implications of open access publishing on reputable journals for Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries. Additionally, we explore the correlation between open access publishing and MENA country classification according to the World Bank. Bibliometric data from Scopus database are used, focusing on researchers from each MENA country. The World Bank determines if a country is low, middle, or high income. The total number of published documents and open access publications are also considered. The study investigates how open access publishing affects university and research center rankings within MENA countries, utilizing Scopus database information. This encompasses the number of open access documents indexed in Scopus and citations from MENA countries. Multiple ranking systems, such as 2024-QS World University Ranking (QSWUR) and 2023-Scimago Institutions Ranking, are assessed. Findings reveal that open access articles contribute to 72% to 95% of citations received by institutions in MENA countries, highlighting the influence of this publishing model. Additionally, the percentage of open access publishing ranges from 32% in low-income countries to 56% in other MENA countries. The study also demonstrates that MENA countries with higher numbers of open access publications are more likely to have institutions ranked in prestigious systems such as QS World University Ranking and Scimago Institutions. It is discovered that the average percentage of citations received from open access publications indexed in Scopus for MENA countries is 82%, indicating the significant impact of open access publishing on academic citations in these nations. We believe that the procedures done in this study for MENA countries can be generalized further for global countries. © The Author(s) 2024.; Open access and MENA countries The open access is a significant model of the article publishing for its availability and accessibility. This research focuses on the useful aspects of the open access model publishing in the Middle East and North Africa countries which are known as MENA countries. The main finding and implications related to the research is that the open access publishing models have their effects on the scientific research output of the institutional performance. For example, it is found that the percentage of the total citations of one of the MENA countries for the open access publications represents about 95% of the total citations. This means that all of the scientific research performance factors which are related to the citations are governed by the open access publishing. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - In spite of the detrimental effects of climate change and decreasing resource efficiency, maize farming is essential to the world’s food and nutritional security. With regard to sustainable maize farming in this environment, conservation agriculture (CA) offers a framework that holds promise in terms of low soil disturbance, perennial soil cover, and sustainable crop rotation. In order to acquire more profound information on the research advancements and publication patterns related to maize under CA scenarios, a bibliometric analysis was conducted. This involved utilizing René Descartes’s Discourse Framework to extract and screen 2587 documents spanning the years 2001 to 2023 from the Dimensions.ai database. The mapping showed that different stakeholders were becoming more interested in maize research under various CA pathways, with a greater emphasis on reaching the second sustainable development target, or “zero hunger”. The most influential journals were “Soil and Tillage Research” and “Field Crops Research”, with 131 and 85 papers with 6861 and 6186 citations, respectively. The performance analysis found “Christian L. Thierfelder” and “Mangi Lal Jat” as the eminent researchers in the areas of maize research under CA. Thus, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) were identified as the important institutions in conducting research pertaining to maize under CA systems, while the United States, India, and Mexico emerged as prominent countries with notable collaboration efforts for imparting research under the given scenarios. Three thematic clusters delineating keywords from three distinct sections—key drivers, objectives, and methodology—were identified through co-word analysis using word clouds, tree maps, and thematic networking of the keywords from the abstract and titles of screened publications. These thematic clusters highlighted the growing emphasis on region-specific studies under CA, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and the Indo-Gangetic plain, to enhance the resilience of the agri-food system. Therefore, mapping maize’s potentialities within the CA framework has revealed the field’s dynamic nature and offers insightful information to researchers and policymakers that could help them plan future studies and cooperative initiatives aimed at boosting the productivity and sustainability of maize-based systems under the CA framework. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Urban historical heritage areas serve as vital repositories of urban culture and history, playing a crucial role in cultural inheritance and the promotion of urban development. The protection and development of these heritage areas are essential for preserving the cultural characteristics and architectural styles of cities. Despite the growing body of research, a comprehensive review of the dynamic evolution, research frontiers, and future trajectories in this field remains absent. To bridge this gap, this study draws on the Web of Science Core Collection database, selecting 828 papers published between 2000 and 2024 that focus on urban historical heritage conservation and development. By employing Python programming and network analysis tools, this study conducted a systematic analysis of research structures and trends over the past 25 years. The results indicate that countries such as China and Italy, along with their respective research institutions, are at the forefront of global research in this area. Furthermore, this study identified research hotspots, including historic districts, sustainable urban development, urban regeneration, risk assessment, 3D modeling, digital documentation, and cultural tourism. This research not only discusses the challenges faced in the field but also explores future development trends, providing new theoretical perspectives and practical guidance for subsequent studies. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The paper examines the academic literature on climate risk coverage through a systematic review in international databases (Web of Science and Scopus). The retrieved documents undergo two types of analysis: bibliometric and content analysis. The results indicate current and increasing interest in the topic, with little collaboration among authors but greater collaboration among countries. Ten thematic clusters are recognized, and it is identified that the topic can be approached from an individual, organizational, or governmental perspective, focusing on different objects of study. Recommendations for public policies emerge, such as the importance of disseminating and sharing information on transboundary climate risks, and for researchers, encouraging studies that analyze agents' propensity to take coverage. Although the findings come solely from international databases, significant practical applications are recognized. The originality lies in mapping literature on a priority topic on the international agenda, identifying knowledge gaps. The article contributes by compiling and synthesizing studies on climate risk coverage, integrating findings and perspectives that provide a conceptual basis for advancing future research. © 2024 Instituto Mexicano de Ejecutivos de Finanzas.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The escalating trend of academic article retractions over the last decades raises concerns about scientific integrity, but heterogeneity in retractions and reasons for them pose a major challenge. We aimed to comprehensively overview systematic reviews focusing on retractions in the biomedical literature. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We abstracted salient features and bibliometric details from shortlisted articles. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses was used for validity appraisal. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 11 reviews were included, published between 2016 and 2023, and reporting on a total of 1851 retracted studies. Several major reasons for retractions were identified, spanning both misconduct (e.g., falsification, duplication, plagiarism) and non-misconduct issues (e.g., unreliable data, publishing problems). Correlates include author-related factors (number of authors, nationality) and journal-related factors (impact factor), with repeat offenders contributing significantly. Impacts of retractions is profound, affecting scholarly credibility, public trust, and resource utilization. CONCLUSIONS: In order to prevent retractions and amend their adverse effects, rigorous and transparent reporting standards, enhanced training in research ethics, strengthened peer review processes, and the establishment of collaborative and integrated research integrity offices are proposed. © 2024 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.

AB  - Global climate warming and intensified summer heatwaves have exacerbated thermal stratification in inland lakes and reservoirs, leading to increased issues of deep-water hypoxia and harmful algae blooms. This study aims to systematically review the developments, barriers, and future directions of thermal phenology in freshwaters under warming conditions through a visualized meta-analysis. According to the Web of Science Core Collection database, we retrieved 3262 articles published between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2023, using an advanced search query that included terms related to global warming, temperature stratification, and freshwater bodies. The data was then analyzed via bibliometric visualization tools to create comprehensive visual maps, highlighting research hotspots and development trends. Key findings include a significant upward trend on this topic, in the annual number of published articles post-2015, in which China and the USA are leading in the publication output. Keyword co-occurrence analysis identified climate change, global warming, and temperature as central themes, with specific environmental issues linking to lake eutrophication and runoff being prominent as well. The study also delves into the collaboration networks among researchers, institutions, and countries, revealing strong international partnerships primarily between China, the USA, and European nations. Based on the analysis, we recommend future research should focus on integrating machine learning and advanced modeling techniques to better predict and mitigate the impacts of climate warming on thermal dynamics of inland waters. By upscaling the research from traditionally local (or regional) to global perspective, our work is vital, not just for science, but also for management of the aquatic systems under rapidly changing climate conditions. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - This paper analyzes the theoretical foundation and practical implications of recognizing the right to a stable climate as a fundamental human right. Further, it examines the intersection of human rights, right to climate, and the intensification of extreme climate events. Through a bibliometric analysis, the study highlights the increase in scholarly attention paid to this nexus. The intensification of extreme climate events, such as the Cumbre Vieja volcano in Spain, is also analyzed as a catalyst for recognizing the right to climate as a human right, as a fundamental requirement for its enactment. Indeed, it is argued that this recognition is necessary to achieve climate justice. These thoughts about the necessity of recognizing the right to climate as a human right are also based on a similar case, the enactment of the rights to water and sanitation, which is presented as a case study, demonstrating how specific environmental rights can be integrated into human rights discourse. The results and discussion section synthesizes these findings, highlighting the imperative of recognizing climate rights to ensure justice and sustainability amidst escalating climate challenges. © 2024 by the authors.

Second, it investigates how algorithmic management affects gig workers’ agency and their capacity for collective action. Lastly, it proposes directions for future research to address power imbalances and enhance worker empowerment. Using a systematic literature review (SLR) and bibliometric analysis of 59 scholarly articles, this study reveals that gig workers, despite the control exerted by opaque algorithms, leverage social networks to enhance their autonomy and bargaining power. These networks enable information sharing, negotiation strategies, and collective actions that challenge platform-driven power asymmetries. The study proposes a comprehensive framework illustrating the interplay of economic, technological, social, and regulatory forces affecting gig workers. These insights offer practical implications for policymakers and platform developers aiming to foster a more equitable gig economy. Future research should explore the long-term impacts on worker well-being and assess the effectiveness of regulatory interventions in addressing power imbalances. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Economic growth modeling is one of the methods a government can use to formulate appropriate economic policies to improve the prosperity of its people. Differential equations and stochastic models play a major role in studying economic growth. This article aims to conduct a literature review on the use of differential equations in relation to stochastics to model economic growth. In addition, this article also discusses the use of differential and stochastic equations in economic growth models in Indonesia. This study involves searching for and selecting articles to obtain a collection of research works relevant to the application of differential and stochastic equations to economic growth models, supported by bibliometric analysis. The results of this literature review show that there is still little research discussing economic growth models using differential equations combined with stochastic models, especially those applied in Indonesia. While the application of these models remains relatively limited, their potential to offer deeper insights into the complex dynamics of economic growth is undeniable. By further developing and refining these models, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors driving growth and the potential implications of various economic policies. This will ultimately equip policy-makers with a more powerful analytical tool for making informed decisions. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - In the evolving landscape of corporate governance, the role of Top Management Teams (TMTs) has transcended traditional decision-making paradigms, becoming integral to the implementation of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). While the existing literature has identified general trends in TMT diversity, stability, and leadership styles, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis focusing on the interplay of these characteristics and their direct implications for CSR strategies. This study employs a literature review and bibliometric analysis of the existing literature up to 2023, utilizing the Scopus database to discern trends and patterns in the TMT–CSR relationship. Findings reveal that TMT characteristics, including diversity in gender, age, and professional background, significantly influence CSR strategies, enhancing organizations’ responsiveness to stakeholder needs. Notably, diverse TMTs demonstrate a greater capacity for developing comprehensive CSR initiatives, particularly when led by executives committed to sustainability and ethical practices. The analysis indicates a growing scholarly interest in this intersection, with a marked increase in publications over the past decade, highlighting the strategic importance of TMTs in shaping CSR outcomes. However, the identified research gaps suggest a need for further exploration of context-specific approaches, particularly in varying regional and industry settings, as well as longitudinal studies to capture the dynamic nature of TMT–CSR relationships over time. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Unlike residential settlements, Chinese traditional defensive settlements (CTDS) are fortress-shaped settlements built by forefathers to resist invasion and defend their homeland. What remains of these settlements today are not only unique defensive entities but also defensive spatial layouts and architectural techniques that reflect military defense strategies and spatial patterns of ancient Chinese society, resulting in a distinct cultural heritage. Using CiteSpace as a research tool and CNKI as a core database, this paper conducts a visual analysis and review of the research related to CTDS, aiming to accurately and intuitively elaborate on the literature distribution characteristics, collaborative characteristics, key issues, research trends, and research hotspots. We found that research on CTDS focuses on three key issues: the composition system and defense mode of northern defensive settlements, the architectural style and cultural characteristics of southern defensive dwellings, and the settlements’ heritage conservation and development planning; and research trends can be divided into three phases. We also propose five future research recommendations. This study helps to fill the gap in the bibliometric review of Chinese traditional defensive settlements, serves as a reference for future priority research directions, and provides a manual for heritage conservation and sustainable development of this special type of settlement. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Although the usage of technology tools in education has been a much-debated topic in recent years, there has been less research on the factors that may affect their effectiveness in preschool settings. The current study methodically collected 264 empirical publications that examine the correlation between technology tools and children's development, specifically focusing on learning performance. This was achieved using a bibliographic analysis that utilises the VOSviewer software. After conducting a systematic review, a total of 6 empirical research studies were evaluated using the OpenMEE programme and ATLAS.ti 9. Researchers are particularly interested in studying the bibliographic networks related to children's development, preschool environment, and technological utilisation. The meta-analysis results indicate that establishing and maintaining engaging and influential technological activities in the classroom can lead to improved individual development. Future research is recommended to investigate the role of various parties, such as families, as moderators in influencing children's development on integrating ICT into education. Encouraging the early use of technology in the classroom can support national policies focused on fostering communities with advanced digital skills and cultivating competent future leaders. © 2024, University of Malaya.

AB  - Language disorder (LD), as a public health concern, has received increasing attention from researchers. This study provides an overview of the knowledge domain of LD research and unveils the thematic patterns and emerging trends. A total of 8,649 articles on LD from 2003 to 2022 were collected from WoS and CiteSpace was employed for data analysis. The study focuses on temporal and geographic distribution, top journals, categories, authors, and co-citation analyses of references. The findings indicate that: (1) LD is of most concern in the fields of linguistics, rehabilitation, audiology and speech-language pathology, psychology, and neuroscience; (2) there is a dominance of the USA and England in LD publications; (3) the main thematic patterns include identification of language problems, neurogenetic mechanisms, diagnostic markers, cognitive mechanisms, auditory processing, and motor speech disorder; (4) the emerging trends include criteria and terminology for language problems, cognitive mechanisms, neurobiological factors, diagnostic markers, the population design, and longitudinal design. Future trends suggest a continued interdisciplinary approach into potential origins of LD, integrating new theoretical insights from linguistics, psychology, neuroscience and genetics, and this integration is enhanced by the application of digital technologies and artificial intelligence for improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. This scientometric analysis provides valuable insights into the evolving landscape of LD research, underscoring the need for more intense collaboration and further investigations in the field of LD. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Groundwater contamination by dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) poses a severe environmental threat due to their persistence and toxicity. Modeling DNAPL contamination is essential for understanding their distribution, predicting contaminant spread, and developing effective remediation strategies, but it is also challenging due to their complex multiphase behavior. Over the past few decades, researchers have developed various models, including multiphase flow, mass transfer, and solute transport models, to simulate the distribution of DNAPLs. To understand the research trends in DNAPL modeling in groundwater, a bibliometric analysis was conducted using CiteSpace based on 614 publications from the WoS Core Collection database (1993–2023). The publications were statistically analyzed, and the research hotspots and trends were summarized. The statistical analysis of the publications indicates that the United States is leading the international research on DNAPL models, followed by China and Canada; the collaboration between countries and disciplines in this field needs to be strengthened. Keyword clustering and burst detection reveal that the current research hotspots focus on multiphase flow models, mass transfer models, back diffusion, and practical applications of the models; the research trends are centered on back diffusion mechanisms, the characterization of contamination source zones, and prediction of the contaminant distribution at real-world sites, as well as optimization of the remediation strategies. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Early publishing, or preprints/e-preprints, is the practice of making research available before formal publication. This research examines early and non-early publications in Library and Information Science, focusing on trends, citation impact, obsolescence, and time lag. It reveals an upward trend in early publications, which, despite their lower quantity, have a higher citation impact. Early publications also demonstrate a longer citing half-life, indicating their sustained relevance. Analysis of time lags reveals that about 49.25% of early publications are formally published within three months, with 75.5% published within six months, and only 5.66% taking more than a year. These findings underscore the importance of early publication in enhancing research impact and visibility.

AB  - The increasing concern about the environment has led to the necessity of ensuring efficient Construction and Demolition Waste Management (C&DWM) in the built environment. Despite the extensive research on C&DWM, the industry still faces significant challenges, including inefficiencies, high costs, and environmental impacts. Meanwhile, incorporating digital technologies (DTs) has emerged as a way to eradicate the challenges of C&DW. In response to the knowledge gap, in this research, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR), incorporating bibliometric, text-mining, and content analysis to meet the research objectives. In total, 126 papers were retrieved from the Scopus database and transferred into VOSviewer to conduct the bibliometric analysis. The findings identified seven specific DTs, namely, blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Robotics, Computer Vision (CV), and Building Information modeling (BIM). This study demonstrates that these technologies play a significant role in promoting efficient C&DWM in the construction industry. The study’s implication lies in its potential to guide industry stakeholders and policymakers in promoting the use of DTs and overcoming the barriers to their adoption, thereby facilitating more efficient and sustainable C&DWM practices. Finally, the findings of our research indicate possible future research directions for promoting DTs for C&DWM and eradicating the barriers to efficient implementation. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The growing consumption of natural resources to meet the needs of road construction has become a significant challenge to environmental sustainability. Additionally, the increase in industrial by-products has raised global concerns due to their environmental impacts. The utilization of industrial by-products in asphalt mixtures offers an effective solution for promoting sustainable practices. The objective of this article is to conduct a bibliometric analysis and citation-based review to characterize and analyze the scientific literature on the use of steel slag aggregates, copper slag, phosphorus slag, bottom ash, fly ash, red mud, silica fume, and foundry sand in asphalt mixtures. Another aim is to identify research gaps and propose recommendations for future studies. The bibliometric analysis was conducted using VOSviewer software version 1.6.18, focusing on authors, co-authorship, bibliographic coupling, and countries. A total of 909 articles were selected for the bibliometric analysis. The findings indicate that more effort is needed to expand the application of industrial by-products in asphalt mixtures. Furthermore, these by-products should be utilized in different types of asphalt mixtures. The incorporation of industrial by-products into asphalt mixes also requires field validation and further laboratory investigations, particularly concerning aging and moisture resistance. In addition, the effects of chemical reactions involving industrial by-products on the long-term performance of asphalt layers should be evaluated. Finally, this article encourages engineers and researchers to intensify their efforts in utilizing industrial by-products for environmental sustainability. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Soil carbon sequestration is an important process of the terrestrial carbon cycle, and even slight changes in soil carbon will trigger drastic variations in the global carbon pool. In this study, we used the CiteSpace software to analyze the development of research on soil organic carbon (SOC) and its current status from various perspectives, with the goal of revealing research hotspots and trends of SOC. A total of 3909 studies published between 2014 and 2023 were included in the analysis. Results show that China and the USA lead with a significant number of publications on SOC, which underscores their considerable interest in the subject. France and the USA exhibit a very high international influence in this field, with their intermediary centrality reaching up to 0.3 and 0.21, respectively. Among institutions, the Chinese Academy of Sciences is the largest contributor in terms of the number of publications, with a high centrality of 0.09, indicating this institution has built close collaboration and significant influence in this field. Kuzyakov Yakov achieved the highest publication record, with Lal Rattan sharing the second position. The hotspots in SOC can be summarized into the following aspects: conservation tillage, carbon sequestration, microbial biomass, and driving forces. The research focus has gradually shifted from macroscopic trends to explanations based on micro-level biological dynamics. Driving forces such as soil type, land use, and environmental conditions have a significant impact on the quantity, turnover, and spatiotemporal distribution of SOC. We highlighted that more attention should be paid to the mechanism of SOC transformation and stabilization, which is essential for developing more precise models of carbon cycling in the soil and for formulating effective strategies to maintain sustainable agriculture and mitigate climate change. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The positive energy district (PED) concept is attracting growing research interest; however, the need for practical approaches to facilitate their implementation remains crucial. This study, framed in the COST Action ‘Positive Energy Districts European Network’, offers a comprehensive review of the roadmaps, pathways, and guidelines—namely ‘PED-Transition Approaches’—currently available to support the implementation of district-scale innovative models, thereby advancing energy transitions and enhancing livability at the city level. The review involved a systematic search and web scraping of documents, including scientific and grey literature, as well as EU-funded projects’ reports. The studies were identified according to multiple filters and eligibility criteria, then categorised in a structured repository using a multidimensional matrix, and finally examined following three-levels of detail (i.e., bibliometric study) overview and in-depth analysis. The findings reflect the main characteristics, gaps, and challenges in PED implementation by underlying the growing need for effective step-by-step, user-centric, and context-based transition approaches. In conclusion, the research, building on an extensive literature of multiple inspirational methodologies and their associated use cases, is a strong basis to develop sequential pathways to facilitate PED implementation among key stakeholders in a short–medium-term perspective towards a climate-neutral city vision. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most common cancer worldwide, significantly contributing to cancer-related deaths and increasingly affecting younger populations. Although its impact on patients' quality of life is profound, scientometric studies on CRC remain underexplored. The objective of this study was to evaluate the scientific literature on CRC from 2014 to 2023, employing a range of scientometric and statistical approaches. Methods: This study obtained CRC-related publications from the Scopus database. The analyses of the collaboration and co-occurrence among countries/regions, institutions, journals, references, authors, and keywords were conducted utilizing VOSviewer, facilitating the identification of key research trends and emergent subjects. Results: A review of Scopus entries yielded 200,385 papers on CRC in the last decade, noting a yearly increase in publications from 2014 to 2023. China emerged as the most prolific contributor with 46,674 documents. A positive correlation was identified between a country's CRC research output and gross domestic product (GDP; r = 0.961, P < 0.001). The journal "Cancers" led to 3006 articles, and H. Brenner stood out as the foremost author with 452 publications. However, the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China led institutional contributions to 3094 papers. Conclusion: With a leading count of 46 674 articles, China dominated CRC research, particularly highlighted by the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China. The primarily obtained keywords were CRC, cancer, prognosis, rectal cancer, and colon cancer. Despite the presence of global collaborations, there is a pressing need for increased research funding and support in the CRC, especially within developing nations. This study is a navigational tool for medical professionals, researchers, and surgical assistants to grasp the international progress and directions in CRC research. © 2024 Academy of Medical Sciences of I.R.

AB  - Social policy relates to a variety of social phenomena. Over recent decades, it has attracted the interest of scholars from a variety of academic disciplines as well as that of national and international organizations. This study applied the bibliometric approach to identify and analyse articles present in the Web of Science database, published in the English language, containing the term social policy in the title, abstract, or author keywords. Bibliometric networks and analyses were conducted using bibliometrix and VOSviewer software. The results show that the publication trend of articles on social policy varied over time and in association with social phenomena; for instance, an increase in publications occurred in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. COVID-19, environmental issues, migration, and austerity were the main social policy topics being addressed in more recent investigations. This paper advances our knowledge about the research trends on the topic of social policy. This analysis included all articles published until the end of 2023 and can thus be considered to be up to date at the time of publication. It highlights the latest topics social policy has become interested in and the range of research disciplines it is associated with. © 2024 by the author.

AB  - The depletion of global resources has intensified efforts to address energy scarcity. One promising area is the use of solar photovoltaic (PV) roofs for energy savings. This study conducts a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 333 articles published between 1993 and 2023 in the Web of Science (WOS) core database to provide a global overview of research on solar photovoltaic (PV) roofs, with a particular emphasis on their energy-saving benefits. The analysis identifies current trends and future development trajectories in this field. Over the past three decades, research on solar PV roofs has shown steady growth, progressing from initial exploration to stable development. Key research themes include integrating renewable energy with building efficiency, the synergistic benefits of green roofs and PV systems, the design and practical application of PV-integrated roofs, and optimization techniques for parametric models. Future research will likely prioritize the efficient integration of PV components with roof maintenance structures, shifting from solely assessing PV component performance to evaluating the holistic performance of roofs and their broader impact on the built environment. This shift underscores the importance of improving the overall sustainability of the building. By aligning research efforts with these emerging trends, stakeholders can contribute to developing more effective and sustainable energy solutions for the future. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Cement-based composites (CBCs) are essential in the construction sector due to their cost-effectiveness, availability, and versatility, but they struggle with low tensile strength and poor heat resistance. Recent advancements have highlighted the potential of nanomaterials, particularly graphene oxide (GO), in enhancing the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of CBCs. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of the incorporation of GO into cementitious composites, examining its impact on microstructure, mechanical properties, rheology, and durability; thus, a bibliometric review and scientometric analysis were conducted to thoroughly evaluate the existing literature. A total of 263 studies were selected for thorough study. It can be concluded that GO content acts as a pore filler, decreasing porosity by 23% and average pore size by 22%, while boosting compressive strength by up to 15% at a 0.05% concentration. It also enhances workability, stability, and resistance to chloride ingress, sulfate attack, alkali–silica reaction, and carbonation. Incorporating GO reduces cement consumption and carbon footprint, leading to more durable structures and supporting sustainable construction by efficiently utilizing waste materials. The optimal GO concentration for these benefits ranges from 0.03% to 0.1% by weight of cement, as higher concentrations may cause agglomeration. GO-modified cementitious materials are well suited for high-performance and durable applications, particularly in environments with chemical and mechanical stresses. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Scientists are increasingly specializing to manage the vast knowledge bases within their domains, making knowledge-sharing strategies essential for scientific progress. Among these strategies, international scientific collaboration has increased markedly. We analyse the role of thematic specialization as one of its drivers in the context of Chagas research, a neglected disease. Since there is a strong research tradition in Latin America on this topic, it is an interesting context to study centre-periphery research dynamics. Using a novel bibliometric database on Chagas research during 1990–2019, we exploit its panel structure in a gravity-type econometric model.The findings show that the degree of specialization and its proximity among partners boost joint publications. Both effects are particularly important for country dyads involving authors from the periphery linked to authors in the centre. This paper is the first empirical study to assess the role of specialization as a driver of international scientific collaboration. © The Author(s) 2024. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - Background: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represent a global health challenge, accounting for 74% of deaths worldwide. One of the recommended interventions to reduce the risk of NCDs is the implementation of warning labels (WLs) on food products to alert consumers about high levels of undesirable nutrients, such as sugar or saturated fats. We aimed to conduct a bibliometric analysis of scientific literature related to WL policies in food and beverages to evaluate global trends and collaborations. Methods: A bibliometric analysis was performed using the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). Articles published between 1998 and 2023 were retrieved using the search terms “warning labels” AND “food” OR “beverage”. Bibliometric indicators, including publication counts, citations, collaborations, and thematic trends, were analyzed using the Bibliometrix package in R and VOSviewer. Results: We included 255 articles on WLs. Scientific production increased markedly from 2018 onwards, with over 30 articles published annually from 2018 to 2023. The most cited article, by Taillie et al., focused on the impact of Chile’s WL policies. The United States had the largest scientific production, followed by Brazil and Chile. Nutrients was the journal with the most publications on this topic. Conclusions: The growth in WL-related research, particularly in Latin America, reflects the increasing implementation of these policies. These results underscore key collaborations and evolving research themes, from food labeling to broader public health impacts, emphasizing the need for continued evaluation of WL effectiveness. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - A company’s “value” is increasingly influenced by three criteria: the way it acts to protect the environment, its attitude towards society and the principles of corporate governance it has adopted. That is the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) acronym, and it has substantial impact on company value. To further understand the ESG landscape in business research, this article aims to analyze the existing literature and present the current state of knowledge, main trends, and future perspectives. Through the Scopus database, the authors examine a sample of 1034 articles spanning from 2006 to 2022. VOSviewer and Biblioshiny packages are used for performance analysis and visualization of the publication trends, the conceptual structure of the field and the research collaborations. The results suggest that the publication and citation trends of ESG register an upward trend over time. In terms of research institutions, most of the influential ones emanate from the US, while a significant percentage of articles were published in top-tier financial journals. Science mapping via co-authorship analysis bifurcates the sample into six clusters and reveals the major themes and their evolution. Keyword analysis unfolds emerging trends that could be further explored. Given the breadth of the sustainability field and the ever-changing business environment, this paper is of great practical importance in motivating companies to engage in ESG activities. To the authors’ knowledge, no other study has attempted a comprehensive and detailed BA covering multiple aspects and dimensions of ESG in the corporate research field. The theoretical framework of this paper fills this gap and offers an in-depth synthesis of all published papers, providing invaluable insights to scholars, the business community and regulatory authorities, and creating alternative research paths for aspiring researchers. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This review paper explores Urban Digital Twins (UDTs) and their crucial role in developing smarter cities, focusing on making urban areas more sustainable and well-planned. The methodology adopted an extensive literature review across multiple academic databases related to UDTs in smart cities, sustainability, and urban environments, conducted by a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer to identify key research trends and qualitative analysis through thematic categorization. This paper shows how UDTs can significantly change how cities are managed and planned by examining examples from cities like Singapore and Dubai. This study points out the main hurdles like gathering data, connecting systems, handling vast amounts of information, and making different technologies work together. It also sheds light on what is missing in current research, such as the need for solid rules for using UDTs effectively, better cooperation between various city systems, and a deeper look into how UDTs affect society. To address research gaps, this study highlights the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration. It also calls for establishing comprehensive models, universal standards, and comparative studies among traditional and UDT methods. Finally, it encourages industry, policymakers, and academics to join forces in realizing sustainable, smart cities. © 2024 by the author.

AB  - With the exponential growth of text data from many sources such as internet content, news stories, scientific literature, and legal documents, the significance of automatic text summarization (ATS) technology is expanding in the field of natural language processing (NLP). Conventional manual techniques for summarizing text are both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, they face challenges in terms of economic viability and feasibility when applied to enormous amounts of data. ATS technology has undergone significant advancements since the 1950s, transitioning from basic rule-based methods to sophisticated systems that utilize machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning. Both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques have achieved substantial gains in this development, leading to progress in text processing technologies. Nevertheless, despite ongoing advancements in ATS, the existing body of literature is still deficient in comprehensive evaluations of its most recent research advancements and forthcoming trends. This deficiency impedes a more profound comprehension of scholarly research and real-world implementations. In order to tackle this issue, this work utilizes bibliometric and content analytic techniques to carry out a thorough systematic evaluation of important literature in the present field of text summarization research, with the goal of delineating contemporary research patterns and technological progress.

AB  - Over the years, energy saving and climate change have sparked a challenge in developing innovative spatial and urban planning tools, methods, and approaches for urban areas and territorial management. This challenge has pointed out a gap in the traditional planning framework in tackling energy and climate issues, highlighting the need for renovated spatial planning practices. The current effective measures carried out by the complex network of stakeholders (public and private) are fragmented, and the role of city networks in shaping decisions and interventions has emerged. In particular, among the approaches for urban and territorial planning and the development of climate-responsive measures, this research adopts a specific focus on voluntary planning. The authors, through a literature review and an analysis of nine city networks, investigated how this approach addresses energy and climate issues and how it is linked to the city networks in designing investments and interventions within the urban context. From the authors’ perspective, city networks are the operative component in designing local experiences and applications, contributing to achievement of the global energy and climate targets according to the current policies. In this context, successful results with respect to climate and energy challenges is expressed in the degree of the awareness and the commitment achieved by the local communities. Moreover, reaching the climate and energy goals is a representation of the outcome of the interaction between the (public or private) actors involved and the degree of a city’s climate-responsiveness, rather than from a normative constraint or an institutional framework. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The use of fossil-based plastics in food packaging poses a serious environmental concern. Pectin, a natural biodegradable polymer, offers a potential solution for environmentally friendly and sustainable food packaging to replace fossil-based plastics. This article reviews the applications of pectin in active and intelligent packaging and analyzes the latest research trends. Bibliometric analysis was used to review the existing literature on pectin in food packaging. Data were collected from the Scopus database, which covers research on film manufacturing and pectin-based coating. Pectin-based active packaging contains antimicrobial and antioxidant compounds such as ascorbic acid and essential oils, which effectively prevent bacterial growth while absorbing oxygen and water vapor. In contrast, pectin-based intelligent packaging allows real-time monitoring of food quality through integrated color-changing indicators, eliminating the need for open packaging. Research trends have shown a significant increase in publications on pectin-based packaging, reflecting the growing interest in sustainable packaging solutions.

AB  - In this study, bibliometric properties of studies on physical activity barriers in men were analyzed using the Biblioshiny interface in R programming language. According to the results of the analysis, a total of 867 articles were published in 397 journals between 1992 and 2024. A great majority of the related studies were produced by American authors and institutions in the USA. The keywords frequently used by the authors were physical activity, exercise, barrier, health, male, and adult. In recent years, the most studied trend topics related to physical activity barriers in men were mellitus, health benefits, university students, stigma, glycemic control, time, and facilitator urban. The present study indicated that there is a need for both individual and institutional studies on physical activity barriers in men. The research results showed that there were still significant gaps in understanding physical activity barriers specific to men. Understanding these gaps is crucial for developing effective interventions, creating targeted health promotion strategies, and informing public health policy. This conclusion suggests that while we have a growing body of research on physical activity barriers in men, there is still much research to be conducted in terms of developing a comprehensive understanding and effective interventions to address these barriers. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Since their creation, geoparks have been among the fastest growing natural environments. Their attractiveness is one of the most important factors for the success of this natural destination. Despite their importance, a bibliometric analysis on geopark attractiveness is missing from the studied databases. The aim of this paper is to synthesise a heterogeneous body of knowledge of geoparks in terms of attractiveness, highlighting the evolution and breadth of the research field. To achieve this, the following objectives were set: (a) to adopt a method based on functions provided by the bibliometrix package to automatically combine databases, namely WoS, Scopus, PubMed and Dimensions, detailing the method used and (b) to analyse the bibliometric indicators in order to identify the trends in the literature and the possible directions for future research. The applied methodology was based on bibliometric analysis using R for non-coders. From the 707 documents retrieved, the validation process resulted in 349 eligible documents published between 2002 and 2024, on which the analysis was carried out. The current study elaborated a method and examined the key information on the topic trends, which were given by production performance, productivity trends, spatial analysis and abstract approach analysis. Additionally, strategic mapping of the conceptual context was performed. Thus, the result provides a description of the automatic method with practical applications. As discerned from the three-dimensional analysis (spatial, temporal and size), the emerging research directions within scientific creativity encompassed (1) forms of tourism practiced in geoparks, especially focused on ecotourism and volcanic tourism; (2) geomorphological features, mineral springs and mud volcanoes; (3) aesthetic aspects, scenic sites and mining heritage; and (4) methodology, data analysis and modelling methods across different regions and countries. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - A growing body of epidemiologic research has examined the potential associations between contaminants in drinking water and various cancers, with a special emphasis on sources of particular concern, including arsenic, asbestos, radon, agricultural chemicals, and byproducts of hazardous waste sites. Given the potential public health implications, a bibliometric analysis of the literature in this field is warranted. This analysis aims to systematically map the progression of research on the relationship between drinking water contaminants and cancer. By identifying emerging trends and knowledge gaps, this analysis can inform future research directions and prioritize areas with the greatest potential for public health impact. In this study, we employed a bibliometric approach to analyze research on drinking water and cancer. We searched for articles in all languages published between 1939 and 2023 using the Scopus database. To ensure the precision of our search, we validated a search strategy using relevant keywords related to drinking water and cancer. The data analysis included bibliometric indicators such as the analysis of citation patterns, publication trends, and the identification of the most productive countries and institutions in this field. Finally, we used VOSviewer software (version 1.6.20) to visualize the data through network and co-occurrence analysis. This visualization helped us identify key research clusters and emerging topics within the field. A comprehensive search of the Scopus database from 1939 to 2023 yielded 11,703 articles related to drinking water and cancer. By focusing on journal articles and excluding errata and retracted documents, the data set was refined to 10,751 publications. The majority (91.06%) of these were original research articles (n = 9790), while reviews accounted for 6.49% (n = 698). The United States was the country that contributed the most articles in this field, contributing 3,268 articles (30.4%), followed by China (n = 1496; 13.9%), Japan (n = 1358; 12.6%), and India (n = 758; 7.1%). Recent research (post-2015) focuses on assessing carcinogenic pollutant risks, mainly in groundwater. In contrast, earlier studies often used animal and human models to explore the carcinogenic effects of various chemicals found in drinking water. This study offers insight into the current research on the link between contaminants in drinking water and cancer. Most of this research focuses on high-income countries, highlighting the need for more studies in low- and middle-income regions. To advance our understanding and develop effective strategies, further research is essential. This includes improving methods for detecting and measuring emerging contaminants, as well as evaluating the impact of water treatment and sanitation practices. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Although first aid research is a wide-ranging and diverse field within medical science, so far no attempts have been made to provide a holistic view of international scientific outputs in the first aid domain. To determine strategic directions for conducting future studies, it is important to understand the status of the research, including its frontiers and blind spots. This study explored the global landscape of first aid research using bibliometric visualization analysis of relevant literature published within the last 20 years. The search yielded a total of 2,057 relevant papers. There was a trend of increasing annual numbers of publications throughout the 20 year period. The following topics were identified as the mainstream directions of first aid research: cross-sectional studies on attitudes and knowledge of first aid; cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation; bleeding and hemorrhage control; burns, scalds, and their management; envenomations and their management; and systematic evaluation of the scientific evidence. Evidence evaluation is one of the main frontiers of first aid research. Studies concerning first aid for the most common and deadliest diseases, including myocardial infarction and stroke, are not in the scope of contemporary international first aid research. Considering that effective implementation of first aid can reduce morbidity and mortality, it is advisable to advance research on first aid management of major emergencies that are the most common potentially avoidable causes of death.

AB  - This article analyzes the climate vulnerability of seaports through a bibliometric review of 45 articles published between 2012 and 2023. The research highlights the increase in publications focusing on the vulnerability of port infrastructure to climate impacts, a topic that previously received less attention compared to operational, economic, and logistical factors, which are frequently discussed in the existing literature. The analysis reinforces the relevance of this study, with the United States, Spain, and the United Kingdom emerging as the most influential countries in this research area. This article also reveals the predominance of methods based on the Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI), which includes ports in its assessments, and emphasizes the need to develop a more robust index for evaluating port vulnerability. Additionally, it discusses current topics, such as sea level rise and the use of global climate models and suggests future research directions to enhance the assessment of port vulnerability in the face of climate change. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Digital transformation has become a topic of interest since public institutions digitalize their processes to improve efficiency, while citizens wish to solve their issues through online platforms. Even if this topic is a priority, the Digital Economy and Society Index reveals that digital public services from UE are under 30% development and implementation. This paper presents the current research made on digital public services and the perspective of Romanian citizens on the adoption of these platforms. The authors conduct bibliometric research to highlight the current progress and concerns. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis is made to determine the perception of Romanian citizens on digital public services and the factors that influence their decision to use them instead of traditional methods. According to the bibliometric analysis, 23 countries showed a raised interest for digital public services after 2020, which was a crucial moment that pushed digitalization among public institutions. Although Romanian citizens are aware of the benefits brought by digital public services, they encounter issues in terms of lack of information and technical support, knowledge, data security, and the complexity of these platforms. Therefore, the government should implement an integrated approach that considers cultural values as well as reliable and accessible digital solutions. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Understanding the patterns of innovative technological collaboration between universities and clusters of high-tech firms, along with the involvement of female inventors, is crucial for both regional and national development. Here, we explore the technological collaboration between Silicon Fen (SF) firms and University of Cambridge (UoC) as a cluster of high-tech businesses and a main research university located in close proximity, respectively, focusing on the involvement of female inventors, based on the evaluation of join patent ownership, and examination of technological collaboration strength (TCS), with respect to the characteristics of firms such as age, size and sector. A quantitative bibliometric approach is utilised to analyse more than 93,000 patents generated by UoC and SF firms. According to the results obtained, smaller and older businesses exhibit greater collaboration bonds with the university, accommodating a greater proportion of collaborative female inventors. Pharma/Biotech sector of Silicon Fen has a greatest value of TCS (1.6 × 10–2), and accommodates the greatest ratio of female inventors (20.8 %). Our findings suggest the need to encourage younger and larger businesses, and those beyond the Pharma/Biotech sector to involve more female inventors in their technological collaboration with university, given that university policies can have a positive impact in addressing the gender gap in technology and innovation. Theoretical and managerial implications of the results are discussed. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This systematic review addressed the need for documentation and analysis of the scope and topical foci of research on education for sustainable development (ESD) in East Asia. The review used descriptive, content, and keyword co-occurrence analyses to synthesize features of 1915 Scopus-indexed journal articles published between 1991 and 2023. The authors found that research interest in ESD in East Asia has grown rapidly, accelerated by the pronouncement of the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development in 2005 and the Sustainability Agenda 2030 in 2015. Researchers in China, Malaysia, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, and Thailand have been the leading contributors to this regional knowledge base. Consistent with global ESD reviews, content analysis revealed that this literature emerged from studies of environmental education and gradually expanded to include sociocultural, economic, and integrated perspectives on sustainability. Keyword co-occurrence analysis revealed three thematic clusters: Environmental Sustainability in Education, Social Sustainability in Education, and Teaching and Learning for Sustainability. Temporal co-word analysis highlighted the research front, which includes environmental research focusing on carbon/energy issues, technology-enhanced learning for sustainability, empirical research methods for studying ESD, and, to a lesser degree, studies of the economic pillar of sustainability in education. Recommendations are offered for future research. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - While it is essential to increase agricultural production to meet the needs of a growing global population, this task is becoming increasingly difficult due to the environmental challenges faced in recent decades. A promising solution to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural production is the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies, such as IoT, UAVs, AI, and Blockchain. However, despite their potential, there is a lack of comprehensive bibliometric analyses that cover the full range of these technologies in agriculture. This gap limits understanding of their integration and impact. This study aims to provide a holistic bibliometric analysis of the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies in agriculture, identifying key research trends and gaps. We analyzed relevant literature using the Scopus database and VOSviewer software (version 1.6.20, Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, The Netherlands)and identified five major thematic clusters within Agriculture 4.0. These clusters were examined to understand the included technologies and their roles in promoting sustainable agricultural practices. The study also identified unexplored technologies that present opportunities for future research. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of the current research landscape in Agriculture 4.0, highlighting areas for innovation and development, and serves as a valuable resource for enhancing sustainable agricultural practices through technological integration. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The increasing challenges of urbanization and climate change have driven the need for innovative stormwater management solutions. Rain gardens, as a nature-based solution (NBS), have emerged as a critical component in urban water management, particularly in enhancing hydrological regulation, water quality, and ecosystem services. This bibliometric review examines the application of rain gardens in urban environments, focusing on their roles in stormwater management, pollutant removal, and ecological enhancement. Data from 728 academic papers published between 2000 and 2023 were analyzed using the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection, employing bibliometric tools such as the “Bibliometrix” R package and CiteSpace. The analysis highlights the increasing global interest in rain gardens, particularly since 2015, with China and the United States leading research efforts. Key findings reveal that rain gardens significantly reduce runoff, improve water quality, and contribute to urban biodiversity. In addition, their integration into public spaces offers landscape esthetics and social benefits, enhancing the quality of life in urban areas. However, challenges remain in optimizing their design for diverse climates and long-term performance. The study underscores the need for further research on plant–soil interactions, pollutant removal mechanisms, and the broader ecological and social contributions of rain gardens. This review provides insights into the evolution of rain garden research and identifies future directions for advancing sustainable urban stormwater management. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the textile industry by improving the prediction of fabric properties and handfeel, which are essential for assessing textile quality and performance. However, the practical application and translation of AI-predicted results into real-world textile production remain unclear, posing challenges for widespread adoption. This paper systematically reviews AI-driven techniques for predicting these characteristics by focusing on model mechanisms, dataset diversity, and prediction accuracy. Among 899 papers initially identified, 39 were selected for in-depth analysis through both bibliometric and content analysis. The review categorizes and evaluates various AI approaches, including machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid models, across different types of fabric. Despite significant advances, challenges remain, such as ensuring model generalization and managing complex fabric behavior. Future research should focus on developing more robust models, integrating sustainability, and refining feature extraction techniques. This review highlights the critical gaps in the literature and provides practical insights to enhance AI-driven prediction of fabric properties, thus guiding future textile innovations. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Eco-efficiency has emerged to reduce environmental impacts and improve competitiveness in various industries, including agriculture. However, the application of eco-efficiency in agroforestry, incorporating social variables, is a relatively recent development. This study conducted a review of the scientific literature on eco-efficiency to address key questions. The analysis utilized the Web of Science Core Collection database, focusing on categories such as sustainable eco-efficiency, agricultural eco-efficiency, forestry eco-efficiency, and socio-eco-efficiency. The objective of this work is to offer a bibliometric analysis on socio-eco-efficiency in agroforestry production systems. The results revealed three stages in eco-efficiency research: an initial stage with low publication numbers, a second stage marked by significant growth and a focus on sustainable development, and a third stage characterized by rapid growth and increasing interest. In the field of agricultural eco-efficiency, there has been a recent increase in publications, reflecting the growing importance of agriculture in eco-efficiency analyses. China emerged as the leading country in terms of scientific advancements in eco-efficiency. The study also identified key research areas and institutions contributing to the literature on agricultural eco-efficiency. Overall, the findings highlight the expanding interest and future potential of socio-eco-efficiency in agroforestry research. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Black carbon is a short-lived climate warming agent and serves as a crucial factor influencing the climate. Numerous models, observations, and laboratory studies have been conducted to quantify black carbon’s direct or indirect impacts on the climate. Here, we applied bibliometric analysis to identify research trends and key topics on black carbon in the climate field. Based on the Web of Science (WOS) Core Collection database, a total of 4903 documents spanning the period from 2000 to 2023 were retrieved and screened, focusing on the topic of black carbon in the climate field, resulting in the Black-Carbon Climate Local (BCL) dataset. Our study examines the influence and trends of major countries, institutions, and authors in this field. The results show that China and the United States hold leading positions in terms of the number of publications. Based on keyword networks, the BCL dataset is segmented into six distinct research directions, and representative keywords of each direction include biomass burning, radiative forcing, air pollution, aerosol optical depth, optical properties, and biochar. This study helps to identify the current research status and trends of black carbon in the climate, highlighting main research directions and emerging topics. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This bibliometric analysis examines research publications from Israel, Austria, and Mexico (2010–2020) using Scopus data. The selection of Austria and Mexico as comparators to Israel was based on SCImago rankings. Top four disciplines were chosen for Health, Physical, and Life Sciences (HPL) and Social and Humanities Sciences (SSH). The findings indicate a distinct preference for closed-access publications; however, a clear ‘open access citation advantage’ emerges nonetheless. Notably, Israel has the lowest SSH publications in open access, yet the highest in closed access. Conversely, open-access HPL publications receive more citations than closed access across all countries. Despite fewer open-access articles, Israel's HPL research surpasses Austria in citations. In SSH, Israel, and Austria's open-access articles attract more citations, while Mexico shows no significant difference. These findings provide insights into publication dynamics, disciplinary influences, and citation patterns.

AB  - Since ancient times, people have used salt for cooking and preserving food, its healing benefits, and as a means of payment. Therefore, the first settlements were located near water, food, and preferably salt, as prerequisites to further social and economic development. Naturally, the social development, the healing properties of salt, and the beauty of some salt landscapes have led to the development of tourism as an essential asset for rural communities. This paper aims to investigate the research focusing on the use of salt resources in tourism and to see if the exploitation of salt landscapes is an actual research topic linked to rural development. The study’s primary objectives are to investigate the scientific output in the tourism field, the main drivers in scientific production, and any connection between the importance of salt landscapes in tourism and sustainable rural development. The article represents a bibliometric analysis of 437 scientific articles published in prestigious journals indexed in the Web of Science until November 2023. The results emphasised a need for more research on using salt landscapes and resources in tourism as a central topic, as most identified studies focus on proposing models for the sustainable development of former salt mines and ecosystem restoration using tourism activity. Since many salt mining operations have been closed and the inhabitants of the neighbouring rural localities have been left without the related income, the results of this research are helpful for specialists in the field and for decision-makers to have a clear view of the development trends of areas rich in salt resources for tourism purposes. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - River and lake health assessment (RLHA) is an important approach to alleviating the conflict between protecting river and lake ecosystems and fostering socioeconomic development, aiming for comprehensive protection, governance, and management. Vegetation, a key component of the riparian zone, supports and maintains river and lake health (RLH) by providing a range of ecological functions. While research on riparian zone vegetation is ongoing, these studies have not yet been synthesized from the perspective of integrating RLHA with the ecological functions of riparian zone vegetation. In this paper, based on the bibliometric method, the relevant literature studies on the topics of RLHA and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing of vegetation were screened and counted, and the keywords were highlighted, respectively. Based on the connotation of RLH, this paper categorizes the indicators of RLHA into five aspects: water space: the critical area from the river and lake water body to the land in the riparian zone; water resources: the amount of water in the river and lake; water environment: the quality of water in the river and lake; water ecology:aquatic organisms in the river and lake; and water services:the function of ecosystem services in the river and lake. Based on these five aspects, this paper analyzes the key role of riparian zone vegetation in RLHA. In this paper, the key roles of riparian zone vegetation in RLHA are summarized as follows: stabilizing riverbanks, purifying water quality, regulating water temperature, providing food, replenishing groundwater, providing biological habitats, and beautifying human habitats. This paper analyzes the application of riparian zone vegetation ecological functions in RLH, summarizing the correlation between RLHA indicators and these ecological functions. Moreover, this paper analyzes the advantages of UAV remote sensing technology in the quantitative monitoring of riparian zone vegetation. This analysis is based on the high spatial and temporal resolution characteristics of UAV remote sensing technology and focuses on monitoring the ecological functions of riparian zone vegetation. On this basis, this paper summarizes the content and indicators of UAV quantitative remote sensing monitoring of riparian zone vegetation for RLHA. It covers several aspects: delineation of riparian zone extent, identification of vegetation types and distribution, the influence of vegetation on changes in the river floodplain, vegetation cover, plant diversity, and the impact of vegetation distribution on biological habitat. This paper summarizes the monitoring objects involved in monitoring riparian zones, riparian zone vegetation, river floodplains, and biological habitats, and summarizes the monitoring indicators for each category. Finally, this paper analyzes the challenges of UAV quantitative remote sensing for riparian zone vegetation at the current stage, including the limitations of UAV platforms and sensors, and the complexity of UAV remote sensing data information. This paper envisages the future application prospects of UAV quantitative remote sensing for riparian zone vegetation, including the development of hardware and software such as UAV platforms, sensors, and data technologies, as well as the development of integrated air-to-ground monitoring systems and the construction of UAV quantitative remote sensing platforms tailored to actual management applications. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - City planners are facing an emergency to develop, promote, and implement actions that allow the mobility needs of people and businesses in cities (and their surroundings) to be satisfied to assure a better quality of life. Among the different actions to promote, there is public transport, which should be the cornerstone of sustainable urban mobility. The only way to achieve the transition from private to public is by integrating services into a multimodal network and then encouraging interchange between different modes of transportation. In this context, the development of mobility as a service (MaaS) solutions is significant, and different studies have been developed in recent years. The paper thus introduces a scientometric review of such a topic in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals of Agenda 2030. The study focuses on the current state of MaaS implementation, trends, and research gaps, with an in-depth analysis of emerging themes, based on 819 documents selected from the WoS and Scopus databases. Introducing the database, and research methodology, an accurate interpretation of the data generated by the bibliometric analysis, and the primary evaluation parameters are outlined. The identified studies have been then categorized into three thematic groups with the intention of offering a comprehensive study that identifies the shortcomings and difficulties in the research carried out in these areas up to today. Particular attention is paid to how this research relates to the Sustainable Development Goals. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance or AMR in fungal species poses a significant risk to both the health of individuals and the environment. This has been seen as a slow-moving pandemic and as the severity of this issue continues to escalate, an increasing number of research has been conducted on the AMR. If not addressed, the shortage of effective antibiotics endangers everyday medical procedures and has the potential to cause millions of fatalities per year. Studies with antibiotics have been extensive; however, sparse literature is available when it comes to antifungal resistance. As Candida species continue to develop resistance to conventional drugs, it is of the utmost importance to conduct a comprehensive retracing of important research on this area that was published between the years 2015 and 2023. Current antifungal resistance research focuses on the mechanism through which these spreads. The research outputs have also highlighted the need to develop alternative therapy including synergism of phytochemicals derived from plants in combination with conventional drugs. This article examines the significant publications, authors, articles, nations, and keywords related to antifungal resistance in the context of AMR. This work also emphasizes the trends and advancements that have emerged because of these assessments during the past decade. The bibliometric analysis visualization was created using VOSViewer with publication data obtained from the SCOPUS database. The analysis will enhance comprehension of existing issues with antifungal resistance research data and assist new researchers in identifying prominent communities in this sector to gain essential insights. China, the United States, and India have the highest number of publications. The findings also indicated that the number of research that are associated with antifungal resistance is growing on an annual basis.' Copyright 2024, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.

AB  - Objective: This study maps the global research landscape on feeding and eating disorders (FEDs) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Method: We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), bibliometrics, and network analyses to assess 199 peer-reviewed articles from the Web of Science Core Collection, published between 2014 and 2023. Results: The results show an annual publication increase, especially in the last three years. The Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders and the European Eating Disorders Review were the main publishers. Anorexia Nervosa, Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder, food selectivity, mealtime behaviors, parents, children, and females are among the most cited keywords. The main Research Areas were Psychology and Psychiatry, and Pediatrics and Psychology were the most central nodes of the network. The United Kingdom and the United States of America lead in publications and are the most central nodes in the network. King's College London (KCL) and South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust lead the ranking of organizations, with KCL as the most central node in the network. Conclusions: Our study indicates a growing interest in research related to FEDs and ASD. The global landscape of research produced over the last ten years offers insights for future studies and interinstitutional collaborations. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Social learning is the main policy-design mechanism that involves interactions between agents. This study provides an overview of the research on policy design using social learning. Descriptive and co-citation analyses were used to identify emerging research lines and thematic similarities between scientific publications. The database used for the bibliometric analysis contained 271 articles published between 1979 and 2022 in 152 journals indexed by the SSCI. We propose a study based on the origins and the future research agenda of social learning for policy design. The results reveal that “environment”, “governance”, and “social” represent the knowledge base. These topics have evolved over time and have become established as a consolidated intellectual structure. In addition, a new topic called “media and news” has emerged, focusing on the challenges of spreading fake news and learning manipulation in a post-truth world. The cluster “Media and news” is gaining significance due to its impact on the dissemination of information and the shaping of opinions in contemporary society. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Background and objective Transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) persons experience health inequities compared to their cisgender peers, which is in part related to limited evidence informing their care. Thus, we aimed to describe the literature informing care provision of TGD individuals. Data source, eligibility criteria, and synthesis methods Literature cited by the World Professional Association of Transgender Health Standards of Care Version 8 was reviewed. Original research articles, excluding systematic reviews (n = 74), were assessed (n = 1809). Studies where the population of interest were only caregivers, providers, siblings, partners, or children of TGD individuals were excluded (n = 7). Results were synthesized in a descriptive manner. Results Of 1809 citations, 696 studies met the inclusion criteria. TGD-only populations were represented in 65% of studies. White (38%) participants and young adults (18 to 29 years old, 64%) were the most well-represented study populations. Almost half of studies (45%) were cross-sectional, and approximately a third were longitudinal in nature (37%). Overall, the median number of TGD participants (median [IQR]: 104 [32, 356]) included in each study was approximately one third of included cisgender participants (271 [47, 15405]). In studies where both TGD and cisgender individuals were included (n = 74), the proportion of TGD to cisgender participants was 1:2 [1:20, 1:1]. Less than a third of studies stratified results by sex (32%) or gender (28%), and even fewer included sex (4%) or gender (3%) as a covariate in the analysis. The proportion of studies with populations including both TGD and cisgender participants increased between 1969 and 2023, while the proportion of studies with study populations of unspecified gender identity decreased over the same time period. Conclusions While TGD participant-only studies make up most of the literature informing care of this population, longitudinal studies including a diversity of TGD individuals across life stages are required to improve the quality of evidence.  © 2024 Pattar et al.

AB  - Introduction: Cancer treatments frequently lead to cognitive impairments, affecting a substantial global population. Among various approaches, exercise has emerged as a promising strategy for rehabilitation. However, a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of research in this field is lacking. Methods: We conducted a bibliometric analysis of 10,345 articles sourced from the Web of Science database using the R package “bibliometrix”. Our analysis examined publication trends, leading countries, journals, authors, institutions, keywords, and prevalent themes. Results: Over the past two decades, research on exercise interventions for cancer-related cognitive impairments (CRCI) has advanced significantly. Nonetheless, challenges persist in elucidating underlying mechanisms, developing innovative strategies, and creating effective tools. Conclusions: The number of publications notably increased from 1998 to 2023, although there has been a recent decline in citations. The United States (US) leads in both publications and citations, while China is showing increasing influence. Using Lotka’s Law in our bibliometric analysis, we identified 58 key authors in the field of exercise interventions for CRCI. Leading institutions such as the University of Toronto and Duke University are at the forefront of this research. Although the Journal of Clinical Oncology has fewer publications, it remains influential. Current research focuses on exercise interventions to enhance the quality of life for cancer patients, with particular emphasis on cognitive rehabilitation in breast cancer and the challenges faced by survivors. Future research should delve deeper into intervention mechanisms, behavioral strategies, telemedicine, and precise cognitive assessment tools. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Dermatophytosis, caused by dermatophytes, affects up to 25% of people globally, with higher rates observed in Africa and Asia. While these infections are usually superficial, they can become severe in immunocompromised individuals. Despite their high prevalence, scientific research on dermatophytes is limited and the epidemiological data available are insufficient. In addition, diagnostic methods are not standardised and there are challenges with resistance to antifungals. Objectives: This study aimed to conduct a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications related to dermatophytes and dermatophytosis to assess research output and trends. Methods: A bibliometric analysis of publications from 2000 to 2023 in Web of Science and Scopus examined trends, citation counts, publication types, key journals, top authors and institutions and funding sources. Results: The analysis revealed a significant increase in dermatophyte-related publications, with 15,868 articles retrieved from the Web of Science and 23,189 from Scopus. Research articles dominated the output, constituting 76.2% in Web of Science and 80% in Scopus. Peak publication years were 2019, 2021 and 2022 in Web of Science, and 2020, 2021 and 2023 in Scopus, with lower output between 2000 and 2002. The United States and India were the leading contributors, followed by Brazil and China, though citation metrics varied. Although there has been a rise in the number of publications, the amount of research conducted on dermatophytes is still very limited in comparison with other types of fungal diseases. Conclusions: Dermatophyte-related research has increased over the past 2 decades. However, research gaps remain, particularly compared with other fungal diseases. Advances in diagnostics, antifungal testing and taxonomic classification are urgently needed. The study underscores the need for continued research and global collaboration to address these issues. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This article explores the spillover effects of economic sanctions against Russia on research in neighbouring countries. The assumption of the paper is that such effects should take place given the high level of regional integration in the post-Soviet area. The study uses bibliometric data retrieved from the Web of Science for analysis; more specifically, the data on publications during 2019, 2021 and 2023 from each of the four countries of interest – Kazakhstan, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. The data was analysed using descriptive statistics and graphs. The results clearly point to the potential presence of negative externalities of economic sanctions on research systems of neighbouring countries not directly involved in the war. The paper discusses implications of the effects and recommendations, which can be used by policy makers to alleviate the effects on the neighbouring countries and by scholars to further investigate the phenomenon. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Melatonin (MLT), its derivatives, and its hybrids have been marked beneficial against several human malignancies by inhibiting the growth of different tumors not only under both in vitro and in vivo conditions but also, specially MLT, for the management of cancer in clinical trials. In this study, a bibliometric analysis of peer-reviewed scientific literature on MLT, as well as their derivatives and hybrids published from 1973 to 16 August 2023 is presented. A total of 2792 articles retrieved in Scopus were analyzed and visualized by VOSviewer 1.6.19. The records show a rise in the number of published papers since 2004. In addition, the main areas of knowledge in which the researchers concentrated the studies were: (i) Biochemistry, Genetics, and Molecular Biology, (ii) Medicine, and (iii) Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Pharmaceutics, with 33.9, 32.4, and 10.1% of the records, respectively. Molecular docking studies of MLT and their anticancer activities for several types of cancer appeared as one of the hotspots of this field. The top five most productive countries—in terms of number of published articles—in studies associated with MLT are the United States, China, Italy, Spain, and Germany. © 2024 Andres F. Yepes et al.

AB  - The objective of this study is to analyze journal publications on tourist education in Indonesia over a 10-year period and suggest new avenues for future research. The study conducted a bibliometric analysis of 241 articles found in the Scopus database from 2003 to 2023. Bibliometric procedures were used to assess research performance and global influence, while Biblioshiny-R and VOSviewer were used to illustrate general research patterns in tourism education. Indonesia emerged as the leading country in terms of publications on tourist education, with Australia and Malaysia ranking second and third, respectively. The year 2021 had the highest number of publications on tourism education. The findings also indicate that tourism education receives relatively less emphasis compared to other tourist themes, such as sustainable tourism, agrotourism, and ecotourism. Therefore, future studies should prioritize the topic of tourist education in Indonesia. Based on the current research findings, all writers affiliated with the top nine institutions are still located on the island of Java. The three primary universities are Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia, Universitas Gadjah Mada, and Brawijaya. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the Word Cloud, it is evident that Bali and Lombok are prominent tourist sites in Indonesia that attract significant attention from researchers. This study suggests that future academics should focus on tourism education in Indonesia, with particular emphasis on expanding research beyond the islands of Java and Bali. © 2024, Malque Publishing.

AB  - Purpose: Medical research is a crucial indicator of a nation's reputation and development. However, there are concerns about the limited orthopedic research in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Therefore, this study conducted bibliometric analysis to investigate orthopedic research output from KSA. Methods: PubMed database for orthopedic articles, with a minimum of one KSA-affiliated orthopedic author published from the year 2000 onwards, was searched. This excluded duplicate articles, corrections, letters, editorials, commentaries, and brief communications. The titles of the included articles, publication years, first and corresponding authors' primary affiliations and countries, countries and institutes of research, and total citations were noted. Thereafter, year-wise research contribution, top contributing and collaborating nations, top contributing affiliations, study types, levels of evidence, journal distribution, their impact factor, h-index and quartile-related information, and citation trends were analyzed. Results: The search strategy yielded 1047 eligible articles. An increasing trend in research contributions in recent years was observed, with the least number of articles (8) contributed in 2005 and the most (140) in 2023. The research was conducted in KSA for most articles (83.48%). Authors from Canada collaborated in 3.44% of the articles. King Saud University was the top contributing institution (17.38% of all articles). There were 66 (6.30%) basic science studies and 873 (83.3%) clinical studies. Among non-basic science studies, 84.51% had level IV evidence. Overall, 73.83% of articles had either first/corresponding or both authorships from KSA-affiliated orthopedic authors. The eligible articles were published in 303 journals, with a mean impact factor of 3.04 (range 0.4-51.1, 165 journals) and a mean h-index of 59.2 (range 1-367, 277 journals). Overall, 31.23% of articles with quartile information available were published in first-quartile journals. Conclusions: The orthopedic research productivity in KSA is limited. However, there has been an increasing trend in orthopedic research in recent years. Nevertheless, the quality of clinical research, particularly the level of evidence, needs improvement. Therefore, further efforts should be made to strengthen research opportunities and encourage research participation among orthopedic and medical institutes. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - ChatGPT and Bard (now known as Gemini) are becoming indispensable resources for researchers, academicians and diverse stakeholders within the academic landscape. At the same time, traditional digital tools such as scholarly databases continue to be widely used. Web of Science and Scopus are the most extensive academic databases and are generally regarded as consistently reliable scholarly research resources. With the increasing acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) in academic writing, this study focuses on understanding the reliability of the new AI models compared to Scopus and Web of Science. The study includes a bibliometric analysis of green, sustainable and ecological buying behaviour, covering the period from 1 January 2011 to 21 May 2023. These results are used to compare the results from the AI and the traditional scholarly databases on several parameters. Overall, the findings suggest that AI models like ChatGPT and Bard are not yet reliable for academic writing tasks. It appears to be too early to depend on AI for such tasks. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The study of monsoon variability in India has been the focus of scientific research for many decades due to its impact on agricultural production and the national economy. This study aims to understand the research trend over time and analyses those issues using bibliometric analysis with systematic literature review and meta analysis. A bibliometric and meta analysis was developed to analyses Scopus metadata documents from 1978 to 2022 by using bibliometric R-tool. The meta analysis was conducted at four broad bibliometric indices levels- authors, sources, affiliation and collaboration. The result shows the major area of the research in this field, as well as the institution, authors and journal, are inter-link with each other. Collaboration networks are found between a close group of researchers, institutions and countries, but international collaborations are growing. The reference spectroscopy helps to identify the historical root of this study. This study has created a bridge between the previous research findings and the research gap and how researchers can work on this research gap to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) 2, 6 and 13 that are also incorporated through a unified framework. The findings will be helpful for researchers at various stages in the field of monsoon variability by providing an extensive overview and authoritative literature review. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korea Spatial Information Society 2024.

AB  - Despite the globalization of health information, collaborations between high-income countries (HICs) and low/middle-income countries (LMICs), while present, could still increase. This study builds on previous research highlighting LMIC underrepresentation in neurosurgery literature. We conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis using the Scopus database to investigate collaborative neurosurgical research between HIC institutions and those in low-income country (LIC)/LMICs. Articles published between 2018 and 2020 were examined. Articles were categorized into 3 groups: guidelines, conferences, and consensus statements; articles related to training and collaborations; and other articles. We categorized articles and authors by country, role, and specific subtopic. We included 238 reports from 34 neurosurgical journals for analysis. Geographic distribution indicated that India led LIC/LMIC contributions (25.21%). Among HICs, the United States had the highest contribution (47.76%). In collaborative studies, Uganda, Cameroon, Tanzania, Indonesia, and Nigeria made significant contributions. LICs and LMICs accounted for 446 authors, while HICs contributed with 592. India has presented the highest number of authors in significant positions. In HICs, significant positions are recognized in USA articles. When scoring authors’ position in collaborative papers, still HICs had a clear prevalence. The highest number of collaborations between HICs and LICs/LMICs has been observed in articles related to training and collaborations. Kenya matched India’s contributions in training and collaborations. Global guidelines and consensus papers can enhance patient care, but LMICs’ involvement remains limited. Further attention to training and collaboration initiatives is needed. This study emphasizes the importance of promoting collaboration and training between countries with varying resources to advance neurosurgical care globally. Copyright © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to report the results of a bibliometric analysis on the modern corpus of literature pertaining to endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV). Prior bibliometrics studies on ETV have focused on highly cited articles, but an advanced bibliometric analysis has not yet been conducted. METHODS The authors queried the Web of Science (WoS) for (ALL = (endoscopic third ventriculostomy)) OR (ALL = (ETV) AND ALL = (neurosurgery)). Articles or reviews published in English were included. Articles, along with their metadata, were exported. Statistical, bibliometric, and network analyses were performed using the Bibliometrix R package and various Python packages. Reference publication year spectroscopy (RPYS), a method that analyzes the frequency with which references are cited in terms of these references’ publication years, was employed to explore the historical roots of the field. RESULTS Between 1994 and 2023, 1663 documents were identified (1382 articles) from 5457 authors. The mean annual growth rate of publications was 4.9%. International coauthorship increased 4-fold over this time period and was noted for 18.95% of published studies from 2011 to 2023. We observed that Child’s Nervous System published the most articles, Journal of Neurosurgery (JNS) articles were cited most frequently, and JNS: Pediatrics articles had the highest impact. Female coauthorship increased from < 1% of published studies before 2000 to 19% by 2022, with an increase in female first authorship from 2% in 2005 to 22% in 2022 and at least 1 female coauthor rising from 3% in 2000 to 68% in 2022. Likewise, minority authorship has increased, as in the early ETV literature > 75% of authors were White while currently only 43% are White. The authors of this study also identified the most prolific authors on the subject. Early in the publication record, etiological and technical terms such as “aqueductal stenosis” and “technical note” predominated. More recently, “complications,” “failure,” “success,” “neuroendoscopy,” and “choroid plexus cauterization” were prominent. Utilizing RPYS, the authors identified 32 articles that comprise the foundational articles on ETV, published between 1966 and 2010. CONCLUSIONS Interest in ETV increased in the 1990s with the advent of advanced endoscopic technologies—particularly digital video. The focus of research has shifted from etiology to outcomes, complication management, and technical mastery. ©AANS 2024, except where prohibited by US copyright law.

AB  - This research aims to figure out the most effective method in teaching vocational school students about steam engines as electricity generators, comparing experimental demonstrations with conventional approach in implementing the Merdeka curriculum. Using an experimental design technique with a pre-test and post-test, 60 student in class XI vocational students specializing in electrical power engineering were divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group received experiential learning with video tutorials, whereas the control group only use conventional approach. Scores before and after tests, as well as N-Gain scores, were analysed to evaluate learning improvements. Hypothesis testing involved descriptive statistical analysis (normality and homogeneity tests) and inferential analysis (paired sample t-test). Bibliometric research supported the study. The results showed that the academic achievement of the two groups were significantly different; the experimental group showed a greater N-Gain value than the control group. The paired sample t-test confirmed significant differences with a 2-tailed value < 0.05, proving the most efficient way to teach vocational students is through experimental demonstration. This method not only enhances learning success but also supports the implementation of SDGs and the Merdeka curriculum, which emphasizes flexibility and local context relevance. Students are more equipped to help achieve goals like clean and affordable energy (SDG 7), industry, innovation, and infrastructure (SDG 9), high-quality education (SDG 4), and Climate Action (SDG 13). © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.

AB  - Life skills have been proven to help students overcome various problems. Therefore, they have been integrated into various student learning activities. However, have life skills also been integrated into physical education teaching for students with disabilities? This study aims to investigate the bibliometric publication of articles on teaching life skills to students with disabilities in physical education. The inspection was conducted on June 1, 2024, based on the Scopus platform using the term "teaching life skills to students with disabilities in physical education" with the doc-type article, review, and conference paper. In addition to using the Scopus analysis engine, researchers used metric analysis from Publish or Perish and visualization analysis from VOSviewer. Over the past 51 years, researchers have only managed to publish 18 Scopus documents on teaching life skills in physical education for students with disabilities. In addition, from the keyword corpus, only the keyword "disability" has networking with the keyword "daily life activity," unfortunately the networking is the furthest from other keywords. Meanwhile, from the title and abstract corpus, the term "life skills" was not found in the networking map. Thus, teaching life skills in physical education for people with disabilities has not received serious attention from researchers worldwide, so future studies on teaching life skills in physical education for people with disabilities have great potential to be explored. Future investigations can expand data collection platforms beyond Scopus, such as WoS, ERIC, DOAJ, and others, to gather more comprehensive data in discussing life skills teaching for students with disabilities in physical education. © Federación Española de Asociaciones de Docentes de Educación Física (FEADEF)

AB  - Previous literature reviews and bibliometric studies have paid much attention to the scientific outputs of Zoltán Dörnyei, a leading figure in the field of second language acquisition and education. However, little attention has been paid to his scholarly impact. This study aims to analyze all publications citing his 87 works in Scopus. Bibliometrix, a comprehensive bibliometric tool, was run to analyze 7,621 documents published in 1,970 sources by 9,226 authors of 2,652 institutions across 99 countries between 1991 and 2023. The analyses include the publication trend, research contributors, including authors, document elements including keywords, collaboration networks of research contributors, shared references, and frequently used keywords. Although most documents were written in English in the fields of social sciences as well as arts and humanities, his impact could be observed across other subject areas and languages. Further discussion elaborated on four major themes of the publications, including motivation, L2 motivational self-system, language learning, and positive psychology. This study could provide researchers and educators with valuable insights into understanding and improving language acquisition processes based on Dörnyei’s incalculable intellectual contribution. As this study focused on quantitative citation analysis, future research on how Dörnyei’s works were cited could provide deeper insights into his impact. © 2024, Sanata Dharma University.

AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a leading cause of neurodevelopmental disability globally. International organizations have highlighted an urgent need for improved prevention, diagnosis, and support. However, the evidence base needed to inform this is thought to be limited. We conducted two complementary reviews to (i) describe trends in the volume and characteristics of original FASD research articles (Review 1) and (ii) compare the volume of published research on FASD to that of other neurodevelopmental disorders (Review 2). In Review 1, we systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycInfo for original studies with FASD terms in the title, published between 2000 and 2023. We summarised study characteristics including the article topic(s), sample population, country of origin, and publication year using quantitative content analysis and time-series plots. A total of 854 studies were eligible. Studies showed a relative focus on diagnosis and screening, compared to prevention and intervention. FASD research originated from 31 countries, however most countries (68%) had fewer than 10 articles published over the 23-year review period. In Review 2, we searched PubMed for records published between 2000 and 2023 with FASD, autism, or attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) terms in the title. We compared the volume of records for these conditions using descriptive statistics and time-series plots. Of the 64,069 records retrieved, 2% were for FASD, compared to 60% for autism and 38% for ADHD. FASD remains considerably under-researched. While there has been an increase in the number of original FASD research articles published annually over time, this is much lower than expected compared to publication trends for other neurodevelopmental conditions, and the wider scientific literature. Further research is needed to understand the impact of FASD across the lifespan, to inform evidence-based policy and support, and to advance progress in strength-based, stigma-reducing approaches to FASD research and practice. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - In recent years, due to the enormous threats posed by emerging pollutants to aquatic ecosystems, scholars have increasingly focused on the study of emerging pollutants to ensure the safety of aquatic ecosystems. This paper uses the bibliometrix package to conduct a bibliometric analysis of 1000 papers published between 2008 and 2024 in the field of emerging pollutants (EPs) wastewater treatment, retrieved through the online version of the Web of Science Core Collection database. It analyzes some basic characteristics of the retrieved literature, such as the number of annual publications, publication types, and sources, with China, India, and Spain contributing the most related publications. By analyzing highly cited literature, we can conclude that “pharmaceuticals” and “personal care products” have become focal points in recent years. This indicates a growing academic interest in detecting and removing such pollutants. The European Commission proposed water policies in 2000 and 2013 to control surface water quality standards. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has prioritized 126 substances for regulation and has set concentration limits for them. China has formulated the “14th Five-Year Plan for Ecological and Environmental Protection” (2021–2025) to assess and monitor chemicals of environmental concern and identify new high-risk pollutants. Currently, gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC) is widely regarded as the preferred method for measuring EPs in aquatic environments, but the efficiency of detection technologies remains a problem. In recent years, various advanced treatment technologies have been proposed, such as oxidation processes, constructed wetlands, and enzymatic treatment, but the application effectiveness of these treatment technologies remains unsatisfactory. Therefore, detecting and removing emerging pollutants from wastewater remains a significant research challenge. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Based on the bibliometric method, relevant research literature in the field of cranberry food included in the CNKI database from 2013 to 2023 was searched and further analyzed. A total of 444 Chinese and English literatures were obtained through screening, and CiteSpace software was used to analyze the current research status and hotspots in this field from the perspectives of annual publication volume, issuing journals, countries, authors and their institutions, as well as co-occurrences, clustering, and emergent words of keywords. The results showed that the overall trend of the number of publications from 2013 to 2023 was stable, with an average of about 40 publications per year. The journal with the highest number of publications was Food Chemistry (25), which accounted for 6% of the total literature, followed by Food & Function (22) and Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry (20). The top 3 countries in terms of the number of articles published were the United States, Poland, and Canada. The author with the most postings was Christina Khoo (17), a researcher from Ocean Spray, USA. The keyword analysis in the CNKI database showed that the keywords with the highest frequency were cranberry, proanthocyanidins, cranberry juice, bioactive components, urinary tract infection, antioxidant properties, intestinal microbiota and processing, health functions, and so on. The hotspots of the literature research in the field of cranberry food were mostly focused on the study of cranberry composition and function, and the exploration of the application of new processed products such as cranberry juice in the food industry. By comprehensively analyzing the literature in the CNKI database, this article can point out the direction for researchers in China cranberry food industry to engage in related research, and provide data references and help in predicting the future development trend of the industry. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This research aims to examine the use of biochar from an environmental law perspective. This research method uses bibliometric analysis with three stages, namely harvesting data on Google Scholar using publish or perish, screening data in CSV format and visualization using VOSviewer. The research results show that the use of biochar as an alternative solution in reducing world carbon emissions and as an alternative solution in improving soil health, increasing plant growth and also being able to control pests and diseases must be ensured not to violate environmental laws and not endanger the environmental ecosystem. Therefore, further research is needed to ensure that biochar does not harm the environment and there must be detailed legal regulations governing the use of biochar. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.

AB  - Purpose: To compare the characteristics of the top-20 studies about anterior shoulder instability according to the Altmetric Attention Score (AAS) with total citation counts. Methods: Two separate searches were performed for articles related to anterior shoulder instability. The Altmetric search identified the top-20 articles according to AAS. A bibliometric search using Web of Science identified the top-20 most-cited articles. Altmetric criteria were applied to the bibliometric list and vice versa. Results: The AAS from the Altmetric list ranged from 44 to 432. The highest AAS from the bibliometric search was 70. One study appeared in both lists. Most online mentions were from X (formerly Twitter). The geographical breakdown of X mentions saw 71 countries appearing in the Altmetric search versus 21 in the bibliometric search. The total citations in the bibliometric list ranged from 91 to 358 versus 0 to 121 for the Altmetric list. The Altmetric top-20 list contained 8 studies that were Level II or higher versus 3 in the bibliometric list. Conclusions: The top-20 studies according to AAS or citation count are not the same. The top-20 studies by AAS are composed of studies at higher levels of evidence versus the top-20 studies when listed by citation count. Clinical Relevance: Electronic searches are an important way to access information in the modern world. Different search options generate results according to different parameters and may generate different results for the same query. It is important to understand these differences so that users have a better understanding of where the most clinically useful information can be found, especially regarding medical conditions. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Plastic has been known as an artificial polymer whereas environmental microplastics become a global concern. Microplastics are reported to cause immunotoxicity in humans through gut deposition and entering the bloodstream. This study is a comprehensive indication of the recent research on microplastic toxicity in the gastrointestinal system. We performed bibliographic analysis using VOS viewer software and analyzed the data received on microplastics and their impact on gut health which has grown exponentially since 2016. Recent findings also support microplastic toxicity in combination with heavy metals. The smaller particle size and other factors enhanced the adsorption ability of environmental contamination such as heavy metals on microplastic which increased their bioaccumulation. Such toxic complexes of heavy metals and microplastics are a concern to natural ecosystems and environmental biologists. Few reports also demonstrated the biofilm formation on microplastic surfaces which might cause greater environmental as well as human health risks. Notably, terms of determining the microplastics in human tissues through several analytical techniques are still limited to some extent. Future research should be focused on the quantification of microplastics in human tissues, the combined effect of microplastics with other contaminants, and their effects on pre-existing diseases. This study boosts understanding of the potential impacts of microplastic and nanoplastic toxicity in the human gastrointestinal system. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study is to conduct a comprehensive bibliometric analysis to elucidate the landscape of machine learning applications in ischemia research. Methods: The analysis can be divided in three sections: part 1 scrutinizes articles and reviews with "ischemia" in their titles, while part 2 further narrows the focus to publications containing both "ischemia" and "machine learning" in their titles. Additionally, part 3 delves into the examination of the top 50 most cited papers, exploring their thematic focus and co-word dynamics. Results: The findings reveal a significant increase in publications over the years, with notable trends identified through detailed analysis. The growth in publication counts over time, the leading contributors, institutions, geographical distribution of research output and journals are numerically presented for part 1 and part 2. For the top 50 most cited papers the dynamics of co-words, which offer a nuanced understanding of thematic trends and emerging concepts, are presented. Based on the number of citations the top 10 authors were selected, and later for each, total number of publications, h-index, g-index and m-index are provided. Additionally, figures depicting the co-authorship network among authors, departments, and countries involved in the top 50 cited papers may enrich our comprehension of collaborative networks in ischemia research. Conclusion: This comprehensive bibliometric analysis provides valuable insights into the evolving landscape of machine learning applications in ischemia research. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - It gives me great pleasure to explore and synthesize the unique and synergistic contributions of 14 articles for this important special issue, as well as to set future directions for the field of engineering education. Given that evidence-based syntheses help shape key research advances in the medical, psychological, and educational fields, we sought papers that used state-of-the-art methods for systematic reviews and meta-analyses to explore fundamental topics in engineering education. We received many excellent manuscripts, and eventually accepted 14 for this special issue. They cover a range of topics, including reading and writing in engineering, the use of concept maps for assessment in engineering, and other key topics. Most papers used systematic review methods, while three used scoping reviews and bibliometric methods. However, none used meta-analysis. Although this is surprising, it presents an opportunity to call for more rigorous experimental and quantitative research on key topics in engineering education. Experimental studies can uncover cause and effect relationships and enable researchers to draw inferences more easily. While I advocate for all traditions of rigorous research, the collection of reviews in this special issue points to a pressing need for more experimental studies in the field of engineering education. © 2024 American Society for Engineering Education.

AB  - This review article aims to present the evaluation of research progress in the field of adsorption, identified based on 35,245 articles from 2003–2023 utilizing the Scopus database via bibliometric analysis to determine the countries, most active journals, and keyword relationships that indicate knowledge-exchange and collaboration pathways. The role of density functional theory and the second-order (Y) of adsorption modelling such as response surface methodology and artificial neural networks from input items (adsorbent concentration xi, adsorbent type xi2, etc.) has become an option for designing the optimization of specific pollutant degradation as output due to its controllability in optimized experimental conditions for maximum adsorption efficiency. Meanwhile, the development of isotherm models from Freundlich in 1906 to Liu in 2018 shows that adsorption intensity affects the kf by changing the thermodynamic conditions as a consequence. To summarize, the optimization of adsorption properties through various methods and models has led to significant research on carbon and activated carbon (AC) for water remediation, with a trend towards using AC with semiconductors and exploring multifunctional applications. Additionally, carbon (black, fiber, nanotube form) and AC are discussed as materials that have been employed in the fields of civil engineering, energy storage, biomedicine, and sensors due to their conductivity, specific surface area, and detoxification properties. Finally, this review is beneficial for researchers focused on finding the scientific justification and development of carbon and AC as promising adsorbents. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This study delves into the realm of gender diversity research, by scrutinizing published scientific studies from 2013 to 2023. Using the Scopus repository, an analysis is conducted on bibliometric characteristics employing tools such as Vosviewer, R-studio, and SPAR-4. The results indicate a notable 211% surge in gender diversity publications over the span of a decade, predominantly in scholarly periodicals (72.64%). Notably, the United States and the United Kingdom dominate this field, accounting for nearly half of all related research. Eminent scholars such as Galbreath (USA) and Kulik (UK) are recognized for their scholarly contributions, while the journal "Academic Medicine" has emerged as a frontrunner in terms of paper dissemination. In contrast to the abundance of bibliometric analyses in the natural and life sciences, the social sciences, particularly gender diversity studies, have not received commensurate attention. This investigation addresses this gap by providing valuable insights into trends in academic publishing, prominent authors and publications, and the geographical distribution of contributions within this critical domain of social science. Through its comprehensive examination, this study enables future research endeavours by shedding light on significant contributions and areas warranting further exploration. © 2024, Malque Publishing.

AB  - The bioeconomy, a multidisciplinary approach that utilizes biological resources and processes to produce food, energy, and materials, is crucial for achieving sustainable economic development. As we transition to new value chains and technologies, it is essential to investigate bioeconomic solutions to substitute fossil-based production. Advanced modelling techniques are necessary to address the inherent complexity of bioeconomic systems. This study explores the intersection of simulation modelling and the bioeconomy, highlighting the increasing interest in these methodologies. We identified key trends and research gaps within this domain by conducting a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis. Our refined search strategy yielded 12 publications focusing on agent-based modelling (ABM) applications in the bioeconomy, providing insights into micro-level and macro-level analyses. The findings reveal ABM's potential to simulate complex interactions within bioeconomic systems, emphasizing its ability to integrate social, economic, and environmental dimensions. The study uncovers gaps in holistically modelling innovative biorefinery technologies. These insights can help guide future research efforts by showing the need for adaptive and interdisciplinary approaches to enhance knowledge about bioeconomic value networks and to derive measures and strategies for their long-term establishment. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Occupational health has been influenced by societal and industrial changes. This study aimed to clarify topic trends in occupational health research in 1990-2022. METHODS: We conducted a text-mining-adjusted bibliometric study using research titles in occupational health. Data on research titles and the years of publication were collected from 26 peer-reviewed journals on PubMed. Using morphological and correspondence analyses in text mining, we structured research topics into multiple categories and visualized the relationship between all categories and publication years. Statistical analyses were conducted using the text mining software - KH Coder 3.0. RESULTS: We obtained 48 645 articles containing 714 890 words in their titles. The research topics were classified into 4 categories and 17 subcategories, of which those of occupations; countries; non-intervention; psychosocial factors; lifestyle factors; safety; symptoms; therapy and care; and productivity have recently shown an increasing trend. In contrast, the subcategories of risk, chemical factors, disease, and organ damage showed decreasing trends. Chemical factors, which were the main topics in the 1990s, included risk, organ damage, and disease. Productivity, the main topic in the 2020s, co-occurred with lifestyle factors, symptoms, and intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Focal areas in occupational-health research shift according to societal trends. Occupational-health research has primarily analyzed issues in developed countries with capitalist values and may not have sufficiently covered issues in developing countries. It is imperative for policymakers and public funding bodies to determine priorities for investigation in the field.

AB  - This paper presents the global research landscape and scientific progress on occupant thermal comfort in naturally ventilated buildings (OTC-NVB). Despite the growing interest in the area, comprehensive papers on the current status and future developments on the topic are currently lacking. Hence, the publication trends, bibliometric analysis, and systematic literature review of the published documents on OTC-NVB were examined. The search query “Thermal Comfort” AND “Natural Ventilation” AND “Buildings” was designed and executed to recover related documents on the topic from the Elsevier Scopus database. Results showed that 976 documents (comprising articles, conference papers, reviews, etc.) were published on the topic from 1995 to 2021. Further analysis showed that 97.34% of the publications were published in the English language. Richard J.de Dear (University of Sydney, Australia) is the most prolific researcher on OTC-NVB research, while Energy and Buildings has the highest publications. Bibliometric analysis showed high publications, citations, keywords, and co-authorships among researchers, whereas the most occurrent keywords are ventilation, natural ventilation, thermal comfort, buildings, and air conditioning. Systematic literature review demonstrated that OTC-NVB research has progressed significantly from empirical to computer-based studies involving complex mathematical equations, programs, or software like artificial neural networks (ANN) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In general, OTC-NVB research findings indicate that physiological, social, and environmental factors considerably influence OTC in NVBs. Future studies will likely employ artificial intelligence or building performance simulation (BPS) tools to examine relationships between OTC and indoor air/environmental quality, human behavior, novel clothing, or building materials in NVBs. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Thriving at work has gained considerable research attention over the past decades. This study aimed to systematically unpack the knowledge of the past, present, and future of thriving at work by using bibliometric analysis. Following the PRISMA protocol, this study assesses 281 peer-reviewed papers published between 2005 and 2024. Results are as follows: (1) We identify the prominent authors, significant publications, top countries, leading affiliations, and journals in thriving at work. (2) Six clusters (i.e., work–family enrichment, career commitment, servant leadership, challenge stressors, job satisfaction, and psychological capital) are identified based on the keywords that map the emergent core themes via content analysis. (3) Based on the job demands–resources model, we map a detailed framework of thriving at work about its antecedents, moderators, and outcomes. (4) We propose prospective directions for future research using the TCCM (Theory, Context, Characteristics, Method) framework. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

AB  - Deep learning is a significant research field in today’s society, especially in the field of artificial intelligence. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the current state of research in the field of deep learning and to identify areas of intense interest, this paper uses Citespace for research and learning, samples 1863 articles from the Web of Science (WoS) core dataset, which spans the years 2017 to 2023, and adopts the methods of co-occurrence analysis, keyword burst analysis, and co-citation analysis. Information visualization is used to conduct bibliometric analysis, examining keywords, research institutions, authors, and countries. The analysis demonstrates a significant increase in the literature record from 2017 to 2022, followed by a decline from 2022 to 2023. The research on deep learning spans various fields, including computer science, engineering, and telecommunications, which are considered crucial areas of study. China, the USA, and England are leading the way in the field of deep learning research. These countries have established extensive cooperative relationships with many countries, with research institutions and authors playing a vital role in the cooperative network. The current theoretical research hotspots of deep learning mainly include “convolutional neural networks”, “neural networks”, “models”, “classification”, etc. The focus of research in deep learning has shifted from theoretical research to practical applications. It is now being applied in various areas, such as deep reinforcement learning, bearing fault, and semi-supervised learning. In the future, deep learning technology will be applied to more cutting-edge technologies. © (2024), (International Association of Engineers). All rights reserved.

AB  - Electric vehicle batteries (EVBs) are expected to rise explosively due to the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. Recycling critical metals (CMs), such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel, contained in end-of-life EVBs will be crucial to response to resource crises. Under this context, a combination of bibliometric and critical analysis is employed to provide an overview of recycling CMs from EVBs. Despite the relevant studies have been experiencing an upsurge, existing reviews only focus on specific technologies or a certain link in the industrial chain. The entire recycling system has not yet been systematically reviewed. Therefore, this study integrates the industrial chain of CM recycling from EVBs, as well as scrutinizes the recycling entities and technologies. On this basis, the challenges for recycling CMs from EVBs are summarized from the perspective of the industrial chain. The study found that (1) Most electric vehicle users are disconnected from the industrial chain, resulting in a low collection rate of EVBs, further leading to idle capacity in CM recovery plants. (2) Inadequate government intervention for electric vehicle users creates a critical conundrum for EVB collection, apart from the challenges including immature collection patterns. Safety risks and high costs of EVB transportation are also potential challenges. (3) In addition to typical challenges like immature technology and insufficient funding support, the limited application of digital technologies hinders the enhancement of EVB dismantling efficiency along with the industrialized implementation of direct and biological recovery technology. Finally, this study proposes corresponding policy recommendations for addressing the existing challenges. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This bibliometric study examines the relationship between media manipulation and adolescent mental health, analyzing 101 articles published from 2016 to 2024. The research reveals a significant increase in attention post-2016, with the United States, Spain, Australia, and Italy leading contributions. Using PRISMA guidelines and VOSviewer for keyword co-occurrence and co-citation mapping, three main research clusters are identified: cognitive dynamics of misinformation, digital literacy, and the social implications of misinformation. The study emphasizes the need for multidisciplinary efforts to enhance digital literacy and develop informed policy interventions. Findings advocate for proactive strategies to mitigate the negative effects of digital misinformation on youth, including policy reforms for effective content moderation and greater transparency in algorithmic processes. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of context-aware AI systems and better access to mental health services to address the psychological impacts of media manipulation on adolescents. These efforts are essential for fostering a sustainable digital environment that supports the mental well-being of young people. © 2024 by authors.

AB  - Since the proposal of the “Belt and Road” initiative (BRI) in 2013, China’s renewable energy investments in the countries along the route have shown rapid growth and diversification. These investments have shifted from initial product exports and engineering contracts to deeper equity investments and financing cooperation. They not only promote a global energy structure transformation towards green and low-carbon development but also bring significant economic growth and social progress to the participating countries. This study aims to systematically review the research status and trends of renewable energy investments in “Belt and Road” countries through comprehensive bibliometric analysis. Utilizing the Web of Science database and VOS viewer 1.6.17 software for visualization, this research reveals the publication trends, high-impact articles, institutional collaborations, and author networks in this field. Additionally, through keyword co-occurrence network analysis, three core research themes are identified: investment motivations, synergy effects, renewable energy consumption, and international cooperation. This systematic bibliometric analysis not only outlines the current research landscape but also provides important insights for identifying emerging research directions, thereby supporting more in-depth investigations into renewable energy investments within the “Belt and Road” initiative. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - An intense global research effort on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies is generating a rapidly expanding scientific literature. These contributions stem from various disciplines and investigate various CDR concepts and their potential implications. This study conducts an updated analysis of the international research effort on CDR from 2012 to 2023, examining 7893 publications using bibliometric techniques. We focus on the geographic distribution of technology-specific research and the funding driving this research. Significant publication growth is observed post-2015, particularly after 2018 and in 2023, driven primarily by the EU, China, and the US. Notably, biochar, afforestation/reforestation, and soil carbon sequestration are among the most researched CDR options, with direct air carbon capture and storage, bioenergy carbon capture and storage, and blue carbon also receiving substantial attention, especially in 2023. Analysis of scientific funding patterns aligns with these trends. Based on these findings, the study proposes a knowledge roadmap to elucidate emerging trends in CDR literature, offering insights for future research and policy development. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Study Objective: To characterize robotic surgery publications in gynecologic oncology, and to identify factors associated with high citation metrics. Design: A cross-sectional study Setting: Original articles on robotic surgery in gynecologic oncology. Patients: No patients involved. Interventions: Robotic surgeries in gynecologic oncology. Measurements and Main Results: We performed PubMed Medical Subject Headings search for original articles on robotic surgery in gynecologic oncology. We analyzed citation scores and income level of country of publication, as well as factors associated with high citation metrics. Overall, 566 studies during 2005 to 2023 were included. Of those 292, 51.6% were from North America, and 182 32.2% from Europe. The leading tumor site studied was endometrial cancer (57.4%). The majority (87.6%) of studies were retrospective and 13 (2.3%) were randomized controlled trials. Most studies (94.2%) originated in high-income countries. Articles from middle-income countries had lower citations per year as compared to high-income countries (median 1.6 vs 2.5, p =.002) and were published in lower-impact factor journals (median 2.6 vs 4.3, p < .001) when compared with high-income countries. Cervical cancer studies had higher representation in middle-income countries than in high-income countries (48.5% vs 18.4%, p < .001). In a multivariable regression analysis, journal's impact factor [aOR 95% CI 1.26 (1.12–1.40)], cervical cancer topic [aOR 95% CI 3.0 (1.58–5.91)], and North American publications [aOR 95% CI 2.07 (1.08–3.97)] were independently associated with higher number of citations per year. Conclusion: The majority of robotic surgery research in gynecologic oncology is retrospective and from high-income countries. Middle-income countries are not as frequently cited and are predominantly in lower-impact factor journals. © 2024 AAGL

AB  - In recent years neural networks have been used to achieve all 17 SDGs. This paper is directly related to SDG 9. In particular, the application of neural networks in statistics indicates the creation and development of a scientific research infrastructure (including encouraging innovation, SDG 9.5). Also, this paper shows the possibility of the mass practical application of neural networks for statistics in the context of sustainable development (with the possibilit of increasing the number of researchers, SDG 9.5). The paper aims to test the following two hypotheses in the context of SDG 9.5: (1) The rapid growth of scientific interest in neural networks will lead to a decrease in the number of scientific publications in statistics. (2) It is possible to use neural networks for calculating statistical indicators. Bibliometric analysis, mathematical modeling, the calculation of statistical indicators using the new prompt and Excel table z-statistics were used. The scientific novelty lies in the new knowledge obtained by the author for the first time. This study integrates advanced technologies (neural networks) and a traditional field (statistics), which is a significant contribution to innovation and infrastructure development (Indicator 9.5.1). The practical value lies in the ease of the mass use of neural networks for statistical data processing of more than 100,000 units, which is related to Indicator 9.5.2. Thus, this paper represents an important contribution to the stimulation of innovation, thereby building up technological potential and leading to a significant increase in the number of researchers (SDG 9.5). © 2024 by the author.

AB  - Increased societal awareness, stakeholder pressure, stringent environmental norms, and the need to sustain in the competitive business market have demanded environment-friendly manufacturing practices from the industrial communities. Sustainable manufacturing (SM) practices have gained widespread attention as they aim to balance economic, environmental, and social activities of organizations. However, still there is a lacuna in understanding the concept of SM practices and there is a need to monitor the developments related to SM practices. Thus, there is a need to conduct a comprehensive review study for an improved understanding of the progress of SM practices. Accordingly, this study aims to identify various strategies followed by organizations for implementing SM practices. To identify various strategies, 89 articles were selected from the SCOPUS database (published between 2012 and 2022). These 89 articles were selected by using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, a systematic literature review (SLR) technique. The selected articles were investigated based on year, journals, country, research methods, focused industry, and techniques followed. Bibliometric and network analysis were performed to establish cluster domains and to identify evolving research areas. Bibliometric analysis reveals that currently, the industrial communities is emphasizing circular economy models for SM practices. Network analysis identifies six domains of SM practices: lean manufacturing, renewable energy adoption, green manufacturing, life cycle assessment, zero waste manufacturing practices, and circular economy model. To conclude, the important contribution of this study is that it tracks the progress of SM practices over the years and highlights current SM practices. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Periodontitis presents as a sustained deterioration of the periodontium, ultimately resulting in tooth loss. Lumbricus rubellus, a taxonomically recognized species commonly called the earthworm, is a significant component of natural constituents. This extraordinary organism exhibits intrinsic characteristics that confer antibacterial and anti-inflammatory capabilities. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that only a restricted subset of these pharmaceutical compounds has undergone meticulous scrutiny through clinical trials despite the potential effectiveness of L. rubellus in the treatment of periodontitis. The present investigation utilizes the Scopus database to conduct a bibliometric examination of the antioxidant characteristics of diverse strains of L. rubellus. This evaluation is performed through the utilization of the RStudio and VOSviewer applications. Consequently, 55 papers were encompassed within the ultimate bibliometric dataset. Moscow State University is widely acknowledged as a highly productive academic institution with significant global contributions. Mihara H is extensively acknowledged as the author with the highest level of productivity. The scholarly publication by Mihara et al. in 1991 significantly impacted the respective scientific discipline. These results provide insights to stimulate pharmaceutical research collaborations and reveal open issues about L. rubellus in the context of periodontitis therapy. © 2024 Lelly Andayasari et al.

AB  - Hydrogels are widely used to explore emerging minimally invasive strategies for intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) due to their suitability as drug and cell delivery vehicles. There has been no review of the latest research trends and strategies of hydrogel delivery systems in IVDD for the last decade. In this study, we identify the application trends and strategies in this field through bibliometric analysis, including aspects such as publication years, countries and institutions, authors and publications, and co-occurrence of keywords. The results reveal that the literature in this field has been receiving increasing attention with a trend of growth annually. Subsequently, the hotspots of hydrogels in this field were described and discussed in detail, and we proposed the “four core factors”, hydrogels, cells, cell stimulators, and microenvironmental regulation, required for a multifunctional hydrogel for IVDD. Finally, we discuss the popular and emerging mechanistic strategies of hydrogel therapy for IVDD in terms of five aspects: fundamental pathologic changes in IVDD, counteracting cellular senescence, counteracting cell death, improving organelle function, and replenishing exogenous cells. This study provides a reference and a new perspective for future research in this urgently needed field. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This study inquired about Long-Term Athlete Development (LTAD) research development and impact. The study was conducted using a bibliometric analysis and systematic review. There were 100 top citation research articles published between 2009 to 2023 and selected from SCOPUS research journal databases by using the keywords "Long Term Athlete Development" and "LTAD". Furthermore, 10 top citation articles were further investigated by systematic review methods. The study outlines the predominance of journal articles as the main conduit for LTAD discourse, with a notable average citation rate underscoring their influence. The United Kingdom (UK) leads in contributions and citations. The geographical distribution showcases the global engagement and diverse per-spectives within LTAD research. The examination reveals an initial focus on fundamental sports training and coaching roles, progres-sively expanding to include practical LTAD applications, demographic, social dynamics, and physiological nuances. This trajectory demonstrates a multidisciplinary approach that integrates several aspects of athlete development. It also emphasizes the need for more thorough longitudinal research to provide empirical support for the principles of LTAD in a variety of cultural and athletic contexts. Even with the breadth of research, empirical, longitudinal studies are still required to confirm the effectiveness of LTAD models in a variety of cultural and sports contexts. The review calls for enhanced international collaboration to further consolidate LTAD research and practice, advocating for a holistic and inclusive understanding of athlete development that integrates gender and social inclusion. © 2024 Federacion Espanola de Docentes de Educacion Fisica.

AB  - Introduction: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) Large-language models such as ChatGPT have become increasingly popular in various fields. However, the impact of ChatGPT on dental research writing has yet to be quantified. This study aimed to assess ChatGPT's usage in dental research writing and discuss potential advantages and challenges. Methods: Using a bibliometric design, we performed a keyword analysis of specific 'signaling words' indicative of ChatGPT use in the titles/abstracts of 299,695 dental research abstracts indexed PubMed 2018–2024. Statistical comparisons using normalized ratios per 10,000 dental publications compared changes in word frequency before and after the ChatGPT release on November 30, 2022. Results: Before ChatGPT's release, the frequency of abstracts with signaling words was 47.1 per 10,000 papers. After the release, this increased to 224.2 per 10,000 papers, an increase of 177.2 per 10,000 papers (p = 0.014, 95 % CI 53.5–300.7). The word 'delve' showed the most significant usage increase (increased ratio=17.0). Conclusions: This study is among the first to systematically assess the use of GenAI, specifically ChatGPT, in dental research. We found evidence of the use and growth of ChatGPT in dental research publications. This trend indicates the widespread adoption of GenAI-assisted writing in scientific communication, consistent with other scientific fields. While GenAI can potentially increase productivity and inclusivity, it raises concerns such as bias, inaccuracy, and distortion of academic incentives. Therefore, our findings support the need for clear AI guidelines and standards for academic publishing to ensure responsible use and maintain scientific integrity. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - iNtrODUctiON: analyzing highly-cited articles can provide a retrospective assessment of research evolution and predict future developments. the aim of this study was to carry out a bibliometric analysis of the 100 most-cited articles in dentistry by authors with an Italian affiliation. eViDeNce acQUiSitiON: all the articles published in journals indexed under the Scopus category “Dentistry” and with at least one author affiliated to any Italian institution were searched in September 2022. The 100 most-cited articles were selected and relevant data were extracted and summarized. the analysis of co-authorship at country level and co-occurrence of keywords was carried out. eViDeNce SYNtHeSiS: the 100 most-cited articles were published between 1976 and 2020. the number of citations ranged from 235 to 1683, with a mean of 361. the series included 25 citation classics (>400 citations). the majority of articles were classified as expert opinion/narrative reviews (N.=47). Almost half of the articles refer to three predominant disciplines which were implantology, periodontology and restorative dentistry. Only two articles were single-authored. In 30 articles, all the authors had an Italian affiliation and the US was the most frequent country for non-Italian authors. Only one article was published in journals owned by a non-italian publisher. CONCLUSIONS: The present series of highly-cited articles confirms the important role of Italy in dental research. We found an absence of correlation between the level of evidence and the number of citations and a non-homogeneous distribution of highly-cited papers in the different dental disciplines. the majority of articles included in the series shared international co-authorship and were published in high-impact journals. © 2023 eDiZiONi MiNerVa MeDica.

AB  - The digital twin (DT), which involves creating a virtual replica of a physical asset or system, has emerged as a transformative set of tools across various industries. In the oil and gas (O&G) industry, the development of DTs represents a significant evolution in how companies manage complex operations, enhance safety, and optimize decision-making processes. Despite these significant advancements, the underlying tools, technologies, and frameworks for developing DTs in O&G applications remain non-standardized and unfamiliar to many O&G practitioners, highlighting the need for a systematic literature review (SLR) on the topic. Thus, this paper offers an SLR of the existing literature on DT development for O&G from 2018 onwards, utilizing Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection. We provide a comprehensive overview of this field, demonstrate how it is evolving, and highlight standard practices and research opportunities in the area. We perform broad classifications of the 98 studies, categorizing the DTs by their development methodologies, implementation objectives, data acquisition, asset digital development, data integration and preprocessing, data analysis and modeling, evaluation and validation, and deployment tools. We also include a bibliometric analysis of the selected papers, highlighting trends and key contributors. Given the increasing number of new DT developments in O&G and the many new technologies available, we hope to provide guidance on the topic and promote knowledge production and growth concerning the development of DTs for O&G. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Multiple sclerosis is a common inflammatory neurological disease among young adults and is the tenth leading cause of the global burden of disease. Existing common treatments such as pharmacological and palliative therapies do not control the neurodegenerative process or cure multiple sclerosis. Numerous epidemiological surveys, randomised controlled trials, and systematic reviews with meta-analyses support the effects of physical activity on health-related outcomes among patients with multiple sclerosis. Moreover, bibliometric analysis can provide a broad evidence synthesis beyond systematic reviews and meta-analyses, allowing researchers and other stakeholders to obtain a one-stop overview of this research field. Therefore, this bibliometric analysis aims to provide insight into the knowledge structure of the field of physical activity for multiple sclerosis over the past three decades, and to predict emerging research trends. Methods: This study strictly complied with step-by-step guidelines of bibliometric analysis, combining performance analysis and science mapping. Four indexes from the Web of Science Core Collection were selected as data sources, and articles and review articles in the field of physical activity for multiple sclerosis from 1994 to 2023 were included in this analysis. Mircrosoft Excel, RStudio, VOSviewer 1.6.20, and CiteSpace 6.3.R1 (64-bit) Advanced were used to perform performance analysis and science mapping. Results: Over the past three decades, this field published a total of 1,271 documents, with the scientific output showing a rapid upward trend over the past two decades. Robbert W Motl was the most prolific author in this field, with a total of 300 publications. The USA contributed nearly half of the publications in this field (549 documents), and the University of Illinois System was the institution with the highest number of publications (222 documents). Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders was the journal that published the highest number of documents in this field (117 documents), while more than a third of this field's publications were included in the category: Clinical Neurology (438 documents). The Reference co-citation analysis identified three main research trends, including shifts in research methodology, changes in health outcomes in randomised controlled trials, and shifts in different types of physical activity interventions. Combining the results from reference co-citation analysis and citation burst analysis, the combination of behaviour change technique and telerehabilitation may be the emerging research trend. Conclusion: This bibliometric analysis identifies rapid growth in the field of physical activity for multiple sclerosis over the past two decades. Moreover, the combination of performance analysis and science mapping provides insight into knowledge structure in this field and informed future research trends for researchers and the relevant stakeholders. © 2024

AB  - The forecasted global population growth is poised to create a greater exigency for livestock-derived food production, leading to a significant waste generation from the industrial-scale livestock operations, which necessitates to develop sustainable waste management solutions. The heightened demand for livestock and dairy products has driven a surge in cow waste (CW) production. While CW is typically used as organic fertilizer or solid fuel, improper disposal poses potential environmental hazards. Anaerobic digestion and composting transform CW into valuable products, such as biofuels and organic fertilizers, with the potential for electricity and heat generation, biochar production, and advanced friction materials. The CW contains essential inorganic and organic compounds vital for plant functions, including lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, nitrogen, and minerals such as potassium, sulfur, iron, magnesium, copper, cobalt, and manganese. Additionally, the rich microbial diversity in cow dung drives the production of bioenergy carriers like biomethane and biohydrogen, promoting cost-effective energy generation and environmental sustainability. This review employs bibliometric analysis to explore the latest trends in CW applications, with a particular focus on innovative applications such as cellulose extraction, biochar production, microbial fuel cells, and nanoparticle synthesis. It further evaluates the environmental impacts of these technologies and assesses their potential to advance sustainable and cleaner frontiers in the valorization of CW.

AB  - Aims: To evaluate where orthodontic research papers are published and to explore potential relationships between the journal of publication and the characteristics of the research study and authorship. Methods: An online literature search of seven research databases was undertaken to identify orthodontic articles published in English language over a 12-month period (1 January-31 December 2022) (last search: 12 June 2023). Data extracted included journal, article, and author characteristics. Journal legitimacy was assessed using a ternary classification scheme including available blacklists and whitelists, cross-checking of indexing claims and history of sending unsolicited emails. The level of evidence (LOE) of all included studies was assessed using a modified Oxford LOE classification scale. Univariable and multivariable ordinal logistic regression analyses were performed to examine possible associations between the level of evidence, journal discipline, and authorship characteristics. Results: A total of 753 studies, published by 246 unique journal titles, were included and further assessed. Nearly two-thirds of orthodontic papers were published in non-orthodontic journals (62.8%) and over half (55.6%) of the articles were published in open-access policy journals. About a fifth of the articles (21.2%) were published either in presumed predatory journals or in journals of uncertain legitimacy. Journal discipline was significantly associated with the level of evidence. Higher-quality orthodontic studies were more likely published in established orthodontic journals (likelihood ratio test P < .001). Limitations: The identification and classification of predatory journals are challenging due to their covert nature. Conclusions: The majority of orthodontic articles were published in non-orthodontic journals. In addition, approximately one in five orthodontic studies were published in presumed predatory journals or in journals of uncertain legitimacy. Studies with higher levels of evidence were more likely to be published in established orthodontic journals.  © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Donnan dialysis (DD) offers significant opportunities to improve contaminant removal and resource recovery from water and wastewater. Consuming low amounts of chemicals and energy, DD is a sustainable and forward-looking technology. This review conducts a bibliometric analysis of 253 articles published between 1990 and 2023 to identify global research trends in DD. The study reveals key metrics such as publication patterns, most productive countries, authorships, influential articles, and keyword co-occurrence. Specific achievements in the DD field include the development of high-selectivity ion-exchange membranes and hybrid systems combining DD with other separation techniques. Current research directions emphasize nutrient recovery, membrane modification, and numerical analysis to optimize performance. The keyword analysis identified four distinct clusters: environmental applications, nutrient recovery, membrane modification, and modeling. Potential future research directions highlight the need for customized membranes and hybrid systems to tackle emerging contaminants and enhance DD efficiency. The integration of artificial intelligence is projected to accelerate these advancements, enabling more effective solutions for environmental remediation and biomolecule separation. This bibliometric analysis underscores the pivotal role of DD in shaping future research and its potential to address new challenges within the circular economy concept. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: The published literature represents the fundamental basis of any academic specialty, including orthodontics. Orthodontic research outputs provide useful insight into clinical and research priorities, which can help inform future research efforts and resource outputs. In recent years, the need for more patient-reported outcomes in orthodontic research has been highlighted. Objectives: To identify the most common reported research subjects in orthodontics between 2013–23; (2) identify the main outcomes and types of study design associated with this research, including study design related to patient-reported outcomes; and (3) identify trends in this research activity based upon these findings. Material and methods: A literature search was performed in a single electronic database (Scopus) to return all indexed publications with relevance to orthodontics published from 2013 to 2023. The 50 most-cited publications per year were then identified. Publication characteristics were extracted using a data collection sheet. Descriptive statistics including frequency distributions were calculated. Results: A total of 14 397 publications were identified. Publications on orthodontic bonding made up 7.02% of all output, followed by materials (5.88%) and tooth movement (5.42%). Subsequent analysis of the most-cited publications per year revealed the most frequently published subjects were aligners (12.5%), orthodontic tooth movement (9.45%), and digital workflow (9.09%), and the most common study designs were in vitro (19.09%) and retrospective observational studies (15.45%). The most common outcome type was morphological features of malocclusion (26.9%). Conversely, patient-focused measures were only reported in 12.7% of studies. Conclusions: Orthodontic research outputs are dynamic but do show consistent research interest in certain subjects. There is a predilection for the reporting of clinician-focused outcomes; whilst these have some value, more efforts should be focused on conducting rigorous and robust studies that include patient-reported outcomes. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Diatoms are a significant repository of lipids, primarily storing triacylglycerols (TAGs), and serve as a crucial source of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), as well as fucoxanthin. Their versatile applications across medicine, food, cosmetics, aquaculture, and biofuel production underscore their value as a vital biological resource. This study employs bibliometric analysis to explore the publication trends related to diatom fatty acids (FAs) and their associated compounds, offering a comprehensive understanding of research trajectories from past to present, and indicating future directions. Analyzing 2286 articles from the Scopus database, published between 1959 and 2023, we identified the United States as the leading country in diatom FA research, with France as the most productive institution. The USA also leads in fostering international collaborations, engaging with 41 countries. Keyword co-occurrence analysis revealed that EPA and DHA have dominated research interests over the decades, with Phaeodactylum tricornutum emerging as the most frequently studied diatom strain. Initially focused on aquaculture, diatom research expanded to include bioindicator, environmental, and biofuel applications. Recently, fucoxanthin and chrysolaminarin, in combination with FAs, have gained prominence in pharmaceutical research. Additionally, the exploration of metabolic pathways through transcriptomic analysis has become increasingly significant. This study identifies several research gaps in diatom FA research, paving the way for future investigations. We advocate for continued research to fully harness diatom FAs as sustainable biological resources for key industries, including biofuels, feed, food, and pharmaceuticals. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A theory of three-way decision is about thinking, problem-solving, and computing in threes or through triads. In this paper, we review fifteen years of research on three-way decision by using the philosophy-theory-application triad and the who-what-when triad. First, we discuss the philosophy, theory, and application of three-way decision. At the philosophy level, we delve into the philosophical roots and fundamental nature of three-way decision to reveal the underlying philosophical thinking. At the theory level, we provide an insightful analysis of the theory and methodology of three-way decision. At the application level, we examine the integration of three-way decision with other theories and their applications and effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Second, we focus on bibliometrics analytics by using the who-what-when triad, which attempts to answer a fundamental question of “who did what when”. We propose a 3×3 model by applying the 3×3 method of three-way decision. The first 3 is the author-topic-time triad. The second 3 represents a three-level analysis for each of the first three: (1) categorizing authors into the three levels of prolific authors, frequent authors, and occasional authors, (2) classifying topics into the three levels of the core topics, emerging topics, and to-be-explored topics, and (3) dividing articles into the three levels of initial investigations, further developments, and most recent studies. Finally, we perform a bibliometrics analysis of three-way decision articles by using the 3×3 model of three-way decision. The results not only reveal the current status and trend of three-way decision research but also provide a road map for future research. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - New researchers in Performance-Enhancing Thermal Management Strategies (PETS) for photovoltaic (PV) technology struggle with scattered data, hindering their efforts. This research gap is addressed by extracting key information from 1,474 documents in the Web of Science and Scopus databases and conducting a thorough data analysis. The findings reveal three phases of the trend inception, gradual growth period, tech-advanced period, and rapid progress. The bibliometric results show a 24.98% growth rate, 25.01 citations per document, 2,577 researchers involved, and 275 production sources. China, India, and other Asian countries are the main collaborators in this field, emphasizing the impact of hot climate regions in Asia on the choice of PETS methods. The main researchers collaborating with PETS are Sopian. K, Jie Ji, and Pie Gang. Furthermore, a review of keywords suggests that most experimental and numerical studies have prioritized temporal and performance outcomes, often neglecting long-term practical viability considerations. Future research should prioritize the 4E (Energy, Exergy, Economic and Environmental) analysis approach to address this gap effectively. Advancements in evaporative cooling and PVT technology have evolved in offshore solar plants, PV with heat pumps, and building-integrated PV (BIPV). This analysis sets the stage for future PV advancements in PETS technology. © 2024

AB  - Background: In primary health care, the dissemination of retracted publications through literature reviews, guidelines, and recommendations can have a significant and lasting impact. Despite this potential threat, the retraction consequences and patterns in this domain have not been extensively explored. Therefore, this study investigates the characteristics and ripple effects of retracted papers in primary health care literature. Methods: Retracted publications indexed in PubMed from 1984 to 2022 in primary health care journals underwent bibliometric analysis. The dataset included detailed publication information, from which we derived annual retraction rates and examined trends by journal, authorship, and geographic origin. We further evaluated the extent of influence exerted by retracted papers through postretraction citation analysis. Results: In 44 primary health care journals, 13 articles were retracted over the study period, representing a retraction rate of 0.01%-notably lower than the aggregate rate for all PubMed journals. Despite this, we observed a recent surge in retraction frequency, especially in the last decade. The median interval to retraction was 15 months, with scientific misconduct, specifically fabrication, and plagiarism, as the predominant reasons. After retraction, the articles continued to exert considerable influence, averaging 25 citations per article with a 78.1% postretraction citation prevalence. Conclusion: Retractions resulting from scientific misconduct in primary health care are increasing, with a substantial portion of such work continuing to be cited. This trend underscores the urgent need to improve research ethics and develop mechanisms that help primary care physicians discern reliable information, thereby reducing the reliance on compromised literature.

AB  - Background: The subspecialized, clinically complex nature of neurosurgery should not result in marginalization or under-representation of neurosurgical scientific output. This study aims to provide an overview of the trends of neurosurgical publications in high-impact medical journals during the past 3 decades. Methods: An electronic database search was performed to identify all articles affiliated with neurosurgery departments published in 10 highly regarded medical journals. The trend of the proportion of neurosurgical publications to total publications in these journals was examined over time. Subgroup analyses on the basis of location, setting, domain, grant source, and topic of the articles were performed. Results: Overall, 2090 neurosurgical publications were identified in the selected journals, comprising 0.26% of those journals’ publications. The proportion of neurosurgical publications to total publications in these journals increased over time, from 0.03% before 1991 to 0.35% after 2020. Most studies were single-center (82.7%), clinical (52.4%), and primary research (89%). The United States (40.1%), China (12.4%) and the United Kingdom (7.1%) had the greatest number of neurosurgical publications among those analyzed. The share of clinical neurosurgical articles increased over time compared with basic and translational articles (P = 0.01). Among neurosurgical subspecialties, neuro-oncology (60.1%), vascular (19.0%), and general (7.0%) had the greatest number of publications identified, with substantial increases in vascular publications over time. The mean number of citations per year received by neurosurgical articles has increased over time, from 1.65 (before 1991) to 4.12 (2010–2020). Conclusions: Neurosurgery's proportion of high-impact journal publications has increased over time. © 2024

AB  - (1) Background: Prenatal depression, maternal anxiety, puerperal psychosis, and suicidal thoughts affect child welfare and development and maternal health and mortality. Women in low-income countries suffer maternal mental health issues in 25% of cases during pregnancy and 20% of cases thereafter. However, MMH screening, diagnosis, and reporting are lacking. The primary goals of the present study are twofold, as follows: firstly, to evaluate the importance of screening maternal mental health to alleviate perinatal depression and maternal anxiety, and, secondly, to analyze research patterns and propose novel approaches and procedures to bridge the current research gap and aid practitioners in enhancing the quality of care offered to women exhibiting symptoms of perinatal depression. (2) Methods: We conducted a bibliometric analysis to analyze the research topic, using the bibliometric tools Biblioshiny and VOSviewer, as well as the R statistical programming language. To accomplish our goal, we obtained a total of 243 documents from the Scopus and PubMed databases and conducted an analysis utilizing network, co-occurrence, and multiple correlation approaches. (3) Results: Most of the publications in the field were published between the years 2021 and 2024. The results of this study highlight the significance of shifting from conventional screening methods to digital ones for healthcare professionals to effectively manage the symptoms of maternal mental health associated with postpartum depression. Furthermore, the results of the present study suggest that digital screening can prevent maternal physical morbidity, contribute to psychosocial functioning, and enhance infant physical and cognitive health. (4) Conclusions: The research indicates that it is crucial to adopt and include a computerized screening practice to efficiently and immediately detect and clarify the signs of prenatal to neonatal depression. The introduction of digital screening has led to a decrease in scoring errors, an improvement in screening effectiveness, a decrease in administration times, the creation of clinical and patient reports, and the initiation of referrals for anxiety and depression therapy. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The emergence of the supply chain management (SCM) discipline and its integration with other research fields, such as logistics, has sparked research that aims to combine scientific rigor with business utility. Calls for increased theory-building and practically relevant research have driven the discipline's development. This article advocates the wider use of grounded theory methodology, providing practical guidance to ensure reliable theoretical contributions. The study employs a multi-method approach (bibliometric analysis, mapping review, and state-of-the-art analysis) to quantitatively review existing grounded theory research on logistics and SCM issues, investigate its methodological attributes, and outline its strengths and weaknesses. Based on these findings, guidelines are proposed for methodologically sound grounded theory building in the discipline. Derived from empirically grounded theory studies, these guidelines address issues that hinder the effective use of the method, such as misunderstanding its fundamentals, improper use of literature, coding challenges, inadequate research design, and difficulties in transitioning from analysis to theorizing. By adding an empirical perspective to supplement existing guidelines, the study aims to enhance the quality of SCM research. While grounded theory is not the only solution for advancing the discipline, its judicious use is advocated to bring rigorous, theory-driven, and practice-oriented contributions to logistics and SCM research. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - As the rates of population growth and urbanization increase, solid waste management becomes a global challenge, leading to increased research on co-pyrolysis as a sustainable waste management approach. The studies typically begin with thermogravimetric characteristics and kinetic parameter investigations of various feedstock blends. However, a comprehensive examination of the research landscape and future directions of co-pyrolysis kinetics remains lacking in the literature. Therefore, a bibliometric analysis of 461 Web of Science-indexed publications was conducted to examine topical developments from 2001 to 2022. The topic experienced rapid growth in terms of total publications and citations. Bioresource Technology is the most productive journal, while Energy Conversion and Management is the most influential. Due to extensive policy frameworks and financial support, China has made the most significant impact on the co-pyrolysis kinetics field. South China University of Technology is the most prolific organization due to Ma Xiaoqian and other productive authors’ efforts. Keyword analysis revealed that co-pyrolysis kinetics research mainly emphasizes investigations on thermal decomposition behaviour, chemical kinetics, bio-product characteristics, and synergistic relationships within feedstock blends. Literature review revealed that co-pyrolysis applications of biomass–plastics and biomass–sludge feedstock blends have received notable attention from researchers. However, blending sludge and plastic wastes still requires further exploration despite its potential. Furthermore, the upscaling of co-pyrolysis experiments relies on thermogravimetric and kinetic analyses for optimal feedstock combination and operating conditions, ensuring maximum synergy and desired bio-products. Overall, the study offers crucial insights for co-pyrolysis industry players, potentially solidifying its role in global waste valorisation roadmaps. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective As a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, Baizhu (rhizome of Atractylodes macrocephala, AM) has received extensive attention in recent years in terms of health product development and clinical application. To explore the current status, hotspots and cutting-edge trends of AM research through visual analytical methods, so as to provide a scientific basis for its in-depth development and application. Methods Based on CNKI and Scopus databases, Chinese and English literature on AM research were collected, VOSviewer and CiteSpace software were used for bibliometric analysis, focusing on publication year, country, research institution, journal, author and key-words. Results AM research involved several countries and regions, among which China had made the most outstanding research contribution in this field. The research hotspots focused on the extraction of active ingredients of AM, pharmacological mechanism of action, network pharmacology and molecular docking, etc. The keywords of AM polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides and oxidative stress became the emerging hotspots of the research, which foreshadowed the trend of future research. Conclusion Research interest in AM continues to grow, with China playing an important role in the field, but national cooperation and institutional collaboration are lacking, and it is recommended that international cooperation and inter-institutional exchanges be strengthened in order to promote in-depth development of AM research. Current research focuses on the exploration of the active ingredients and pharmacological mechanisms of AM, while the application of network pharmacology and molecular docking in the field of Atractylodes macrocephala is a relatively novel topic, with more emphasis on the development of health products and clinical applications in the future. © 2024 Editorial Office of Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs.

AB  - Zero Trust is the new cybersecurity model that challenges the traditional one by promoting continuous verification of users, devices, and applications, whatever their position or origin. This model is critical for reducing the attack surface and preventing lateral movement without relying on implicit trust. Adopting the zero trust principle in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), especially in the context of connected vehicles (CVs), presents an adequate solution in the face of increasing cyber threats, thereby strengthening the ITS environment. This paper offers an understanding of Zero Trust security through a comprehensive review of existing literature, principles, and challenges. It specifically examines its applications in emerging technologies, particularly within connected vehicles, addressing potential issues and cyber threats faced by CVs. Inclusion/exclusion criteria for the systematic literature review were planned alongside a bibliometric analysis. Moreover, keywords co-occurrence analysis has been done, which indicates trends and general themes in the whole for Zero Trust model, Zero Trust implementation, and Zero Trust application. Furthermore, the paper explores various ZT models proposed in the literature for connected vehicles, shedding light on the challenges associated with their integration into CV systems. Future directions of this research will focus on incorporating Zero Trust principles within Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication paradigms. This initiative intends to enhance the security posture and safety protocols within interconnected vehicular networks. The proposed research seeks to address the unique cybersecurity vulnerabilities inherent in the highly dynamic nature of vehicular communication systems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Discharge of acidic wastewater from mining activities (acid mine drainage (AMD)) is a major global environmental and public health issue. Although several approaches, including chemical precipitation and membrane technology, have been developed to treat AMD, adsorption has emerged as the most promising technology due to its cost-effectiveness and efficacy. Despite the wide adoption of adsorption in treating AMD, the evolution of research in this area remains poorly understood. To address this gap, a bibliometric analysis of the most recent literature involving the application of adsorption in AMD remediation was conducted by merging datasets of articles from Scopus (1127) and the Web of Science Core Collection (1422), over the past decade (2013–2022). This analysis revealed a yearly increase of 11% in research publications, primarily contributed by China, the United States, and South Africa. Keyword analysis revealed that natural schwertmannites and their transformations, activated carbon, zeolites, and clay minerals, are the most extensively employed adsorbents for the removal of common metals (arsenic, chromium, iron, manganese, among others). The findings underscore the need for future focuses on recovering rare earth elements, using nanoparticles and modified materials, pursuing low-cost, sustainable solutions, integrating hybrid technologies, pilot-scale studies, exploring circular economic applications of AMD sludges, and inter-continental collaborations. These insights hold significant future implications, serving as a valuable reference to stakeholders in the mining industry. © The Author(s) 2024.

This study systematically analyzes 478 publications searched in the Web of Science Core Collection, from 2000 to 2023, utilizing bibliometric methods to investigate the application areas in sustainable development within the shipping industry. This study begins with an analysis of annual publication trends, which reveals a substantial expansion in research endeavors within this discipline over recent years. Subsequently, a comprehensive statistical evaluation of scholarly journals and a collaborative network assessment are conducted to pinpoint the foremost productive journals, nations, organizations, and individual researchers. Furthermore, a keyword co-occurrence methodology is applied to delineate the core research themes and emerging focal points within this domain, thereby outlining potential research directions for future research. In addition, drawing on the keyword co-occurrence analysis, the advancements in intelligent shipping technologies and green port construction applications within sustainable maritime transport are discussed. Finally, the review discusses the existing challenges and opportunities of sustainable maritime transport from a theoretical and practical perspective. The research shows that, in terms of intelligent shipping technology, data security and multi-source data are the focus that people need to pay attention to in the future; a trajectory prediction for different climates and different ship types is also an area for future research. In terms of green ports, Cold Ironing (CI) is one of the key points of the green port strategy, and how to drive stakeholders to build sustainable green ports efficiently and economically is the future developmental direction. This review serves to enhance researchers’ comprehension of the current landscape and progression trajectory of intelligent shipping technologies, thereby fostering the continued advancement and exploration in this vital domain. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Germanium (Ge)-based thermoelectric materials have proven to be a reliable and sustainable solution for efficient energy harvesting across a wide range of temperatures for an extended period. Numerous investigations have been published addressing the future scope of Ge as a thermoelectric material. This article offers a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of the literature related to Germanium-based thermoelectric energy harvesting (Ge-TEH) materials available on Scopus to identify how this material contributes to thermoelectric energy generation. Methodologies such as citation analysis, co-authorship, and co-occurrence analysis are employed to analyze refined data of ‘1867’ documents using 'Visualization of similarity' (VOS) viewer and Biblioshiny. The analysis shows that Ge-TEH has grown significantly worldwide, especially in the last decade. The social and intellectual networks were generated, and the most influencing countries, sources, and institutions were identified. China and the United States (USA) were found to have the highest number of publications, citations, and collaborations. The keywords analysis reveals that ‘lattice thermal conductivity,’ ‘Germanium,’ ‘Seebeck coefficient,’ ‘spark plasma sintering’, and ‘density functional theory’ are the most occurring words, indicating that the dataset features keywords related to thermoelectric materials and their properties. It also suggests a strong emphasis on fabrication methods for optimizing thermoelectric properties. The mutual relevance and categorical patterns of frequently occurring keywords were studied using a factorial analysis graph. This detailed analysis provides critical findings into the evolution and future scope of the research in Ge-TEH. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background: Salivary biomarkers play an important role in the preventive strategy for oral cancer detection at an early stage. The aim of this study was to carry out a comparative quantitative analysis of the research material on the topic in one established database, Scopus and another emerging database, Dimensions. Method: An electronic search was performed in Scopus and Dimensions in April 2024 with the search subjects “Saliva,” “Biomarkers,” “Diagnosis,” and “Oral Cancer.” The retrieved data were analyzed using Biblioshiny for RStudio and MS Excel. Result: The search yielded 229 and 158 documents in Scopus and Dimensions, respectively. The data were studied to understand the coverage, concentration, and diversion of research articles. The analysis revealed high singularity index for Scopus and low overlap percentage between the two databases. Scopus was found to have higher citation count per article, however, the citation correlation between Scopus and Dimensions was found to be strong. Author productivity was found to be low in both the databases. Conclusion: Scopus and Dimensions vary in their scope, volume of data, and coverage policies. Both the databases have complimentary coverage on salivary biomarkers for oral cancer diagnosis. However, Scopus has a greater number of articles, sources, and citations resulting in better coverage of the topic. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Background: Research productivity is on the rise as neurosurgical residency positions become increasingly competitive. We explored the relationship between neurosurgical residency applicant's senior author's research productivity and matching into a neurosurgery residency program. Methods: A retrospective analysis of bibliometric data for applicants who matched into neurosurgery in 2022–2023 and their senior authors was conducted using Scopus. Results: Logistic regression revealed a significant association between h-index values and top 40 match outcomes (P = 0.038). The maximum h-index of senior authors significantly predicted matches at top 40 programs (P = 0.003). Affiliation with a top 40 medical school increased both applicant and senior author h-indices (P = 0.05, P < 0.001 respectively). Linear regression of the maximum h-index of senior authors in preresidency publications explained 42% of this variability (P < 0.001). A multiple linear regression model incorporating this with publication number elucidated 69% of the variance in interns' h-index. Authorship data categorized as first, second, and third author positions showed 1847 first author, 1417 second author, and 118 third author publications over 2-years. Applicants at top 40 residency programs had more first and second author publications compared to those from nontop 40 programs (P = 0.0158, P = 0.0275). Conclusions: There is a strong correlation between a neurosurgical applicant's academic output and that of their senior authors. The number of publications and the maximum h-index of senior authors significantly predict applicant h-indices. We also demonstrated that there is a significant difference in the academic productivity of applicants and senior authors of applicants who successfully match into a top 40 i(h)5 rated neurosurgical residency. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Pelvic organ prolapse is a common condition in middle-aged and older women. Laparoscopic pelvic floor surgery is frequently researched as a treatment for this issue. However, the effectiveness of this procedure has only been the subject of a few studies. Methods: To quantitatively evaluate and display the relevant literature from the Web of Science database, we set the publication period of the literature from 1996 to 2022 and used VOSviewer and CiteSpace for visual analysis. Results: Laparoscopic pelvic floor surgery research has increased year-on-year, with 1003 publications identified from 63 countries and published in 210 journals. In the global ranking of studies, the United States was the leader (n = 306; 30.5 %), with the most published authors being Campagna, Giuseppe (n = 17) and Scambia, Giovanni (n = 17). The International urogynecology journal included the most significant articles (n = 173; 17.2 %). Keyword analysis suggests that complications, rectal prolapse, native tissue repair, and warranty may have become hotspots in recent years. Conclusions: This bibliometric study shows that the depth and breadth of research on pelvic floor laparoscopic surgery have expanded rapidly over the last twenty-five years and that laparoscopic surgery has been recognized by different scholars or countries as an essential modality for the treatment of pelvic floor organ prolapse. © 2024

AB  - China is becoming the world's biggest energy consumer and carbon dioxide emitter due to the excessive worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide. As a result, resource utilization and carbon emission reduction have taken center stage in China's energy growth. This paper provides an overview and analysis of China's annual total carbon emissions from 2012 to 2021, as well as a projection of the country's key carbon emission industries' carbon dioxide emissions over the next several decades. With the help of the Web of Science bibliometric analysis function and the CiteSpace software visual analysis function, it analyzes the systematic knowledge mapping of the research literature related to carbon emission reduction, which corroborates that carbon emission reduction is the future. Further strengthening the research on carbon dioxide resource utilization is expected to add bricks and mortar to the beautiful vision of “carbon neutrality” by 2060. The consumption of hydrogenated carbon dioxide (CO2) for the production of one ton of methanol can reach up to 1431 tons. This process is an effective and environmentally friendly method for reducing carbon emissions. The methodology and mechanism of utilizing carbon dioxide resources for methanol preparation are systematically summarized, with a specific focus on the application of green methanol as ship fuel. The analysis primarily examines the calculation of carbon emissions throughout the entire life cycle of carbon dioxide and the production of green hydrogen for methanol. The hypothesis is that low-carbon methanol emissions are one-third lower than those of fuel oil, and this conclusion is further supported by evidence showing that low-carbon methanol has a significant carbon reduction effect. Simapro 9.0 software was used to evaluate the life cycle of carbon dioxide preparation for methanol production. The results indicated that the factors with the greatest influence are CO2 utilization and green hydrogen production. To make the process more environmentally friendly, the capture process should be improved, and efforts should be made to reduce electricity consumption and coal usage. These measures can effectively reduce the environmental impact of the entire production chain. Furthermore, it anticipates the future utilization of carbon dioxide resources in the application market of the new materials industry, and aims to further advance the development of the methanol industry. © 2024 Indian Chemical Society

AB  - Introduction: Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT/A) is an effective non-surgical method for treating gummy smile (GS). This systematic review evaluated the efficacy, duration, and safety of different BoNT/A injections. Methods: Four electronic databases were searched for relevant literature, generating 1106 references. Results: The review included 13 prospective, controlled clinical trials. The mean pre-injection anterior gingival exposure ranged from 3.5 mm to 6.8 mm, reaching maximum effect at 2–4 weeks post-injection. Most studies indicated complete improvement in gingival exposure post-injection, with gingival exposure reduced to ≤3 mm. The dosage of BoNT/A was determined by the severity of gingival exposure, with effects lasting up to 12–24 weeks. Levator labii superioris alaeque nasi (LLSAN), levator labii superioris (LLS), and zygomaticus minor (ZMi) were the main targeted muscles. Next, bibliometric analysis was conducted to provide an overview of the existing publications on managing gummy smiles. Conclusions: This data demonstrates that BoNT/A can effectively treat various types of GS triggered by muscle hyperactivity. It is a non-intrusive treatment with significant improvement, high safety, minimal side effects, and high patient satisfaction. This study was preregistered in the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42024509183). Clinical significance: This study systematically reviewed and compared previous results on efficacy, duration, patient satisfaction, and adverse effects of different botulinum toxin type A doses and injection sites, laying a solid foundation for further studies that use BoNT/A in the management of gummy smiles. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Crowd accident surveys have shown that regardless of the initial triggering factors, pedestrian fall behavior is the most critical factor causing and aggravating crowd accidents in public traffic areas (PTAs). The application of pedestrian fall behavior detection methods in PTAs is significant. Once deployed, they would prevent many pedestrians from losing life in crowded traffic area accidents. However, most existing methods are still focused on medical assistance for the elderly. Therefore, this paper conducted bibliometric and content analyses, combining fall detection-related keywords from internationally recognized literature databases and benchmark pedestrian behavior datasets. Based on the analysis of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) achievements in fall detection methods, the fall detection methods were classified into different categories according to the research approach. This study undertakes a comprehensive analysis of five predominant methods, namely, computer vision, Internet of Things, smartphone, kinematic, and wearable device-based methods. Furthermore, the benchmark datasets, including fall scenarios, were introduced and compared. Finally, this study provides a detailed discussion of existing fall detection methods, and possible future directions are identified considering the application requirements in PTAs. This overview may help researchers understand the SOTA fall detection methods and devise new methodologies by improving and synthesizing the highlighted issues in PTAs. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Background: In the last two decades, the role of the gut microbiome in the development, maintenance, and outcome of sepsis has received increased attention; however, few descriptive studies exist on its research focus, priorities, and future prospects. This study aimed to identify the current state, evolution, and emerging trends in the field of gut microbiota and sepsis using bibliometric analysis. Methods: All publications on sepsis and gut microbiota were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection and included in this study. VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and the Web of Science online analysis platform were used to visualize trends based on publication country, institution, author, journal, and keywords. Results: A total of 1,882 articles on sepsis-related gut microbiota were screened, mainly from 95 countries or regions and 2,581 institutions. The United States and China contributed the most to this research field, with 521 (27.683 %) and 376 (19.979 %) articles, respectively. Scientists from the University of California were the most prolific, publishing 63 (3.348 %) articles. Cani PD published papers with the highest H-index, establishing himself as a leader in the field. The most publications were published in the journals “Nutrients” and “PLOS One.” The journals with the most co-citations were “PLOS One,” “Nature,” and “Gut.” The most used keywords were prebiotics, gut microbiota, and sepsis. The keyword burst research analysis revealed that research on treatment strategies based on the intestinal microbiota, intestine-liver axis, and regulatory mechanisms of bacterial metabolites are currently hot directions. Conclusion: This study presents a global overview of the current state and potential trends in the field of sepsis-related gut microbiota. This study identified hot research sub-directions and new trends through comparison and analysis, which will aid in the development of this field. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Introduction: Androgenetic alopecia is the most common type of hair loss, and with increasing media integration in medicine, understanding social media consumption of literature is invaluable. Altmetric Attention Score analysis can quantify factors impacting article distribution on media platforms. Methods: To determine factors influencing literature dissemination and reader demographics, a bibliometric analysis was performed on the 100 most cited androgenetic alopecia articles. Results: Articles with top 25th percentile Altmetric Attention Scores were cited more frequently (41.76 vs. 24.59, p < 0.05). Open-access articles had lower odds of being read by healthcare professionals (aOR = 0.16, p < 0.05), while funded studies and journal impact factor increased odds of readership (aOR = 5.80; aOR = 1.55; p < 0.05 for both). Scientists and healthcare professionals showed interest in publications addressing 5a-reductase inhibitors (aOR = 26.08; aOR = 6.13; p < 0.05 for both). Articles with high social media viewership were also highly cited in academic literature. Conclusion: Healthcare professionals appeared more discerning about article readership compared to the public. With many outlets for consumption of media, members of the public not involved in dermatology may have difficulty in identifying reliable sources of material. Overall, Altmetrics can help quantify readership trends and public interest in dermatology research.  © 2024 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Introduction: Since its establishment in 1999, the journal of Clinical Implant Dentistry and Related Research (CIDRR) has consistently disseminated notable clinical and translational research within the domain of oral implantology. As the journal approaches its milestone 25th anniversary, this study endeavors to systematically delineate the publication trends, level of evidence, and bibliometric indices characterizing the initial quarter-century of CIDRR's scholarly activity. Notably, the investigation adopts a contemporary methodology by incorporating Altmetric analysis, thereby enriching the evaluation with an assessment of the broader societal and online impact of the published research. Methods: A comprehensive search was performed in SCOPUS and PubMed to access the bibliographic data of all articles published in the journal from 1999 to 2024. Additionally, Altmetric database was used to obtain social media attention scores (AAS). Journal's overall performance via impact factor and quartile range was assessed. Most cited papers were identified and the most prolific authors, institutions and countries and the collaboration networks among those were assessed. The level of evidence of all articles was determined based on Oxford level of evidence scale. All articles were categorized based on their major topic in the field of implant dentistry. Results: Throughout its first 25 years of activity, CIDRR published 1912 articles with an annual growth rate of 2.67% and consistently being ranked at Q1 quartile in “Dentistry (miscellaneous)” and “Oral Surgery” journal categories. When clinical studies are considered, level I and II evidence constituted 22.82% and 11.82% of all articles, respectively. Sweden, the USA, and Italy as well as Göteborgs Universitet, Sahlgrenska Akademin. and Malmö Högskola were the most prolific countries and institutions respectively. “Implant system/design/characteristics,” “Bone Augmentation,” and “Implant Prosthesis” were the top most investigated topics. Conclusions: The examination of the journal's initial 25 years highlighted that CIDRR has surpassed similar dental research journals in publishing a greater number of high-level evidence articles. It also showcased diverse country- and author-collaboration networks. However, the journal's social media presence is still evolving. This article, presenting a comprehensive overview of the journal's scientometric and bibliographic activities, serves as a valuable reference for researchers, clinicians, and stakeholders, offering insights into both traditional and contemporary perspectives. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Higher education institutions (HEIs) are encountering numerous challenges in today's era of globalization and internationalization. Among these challenges, digital transformation stands out as one of the most demanding, as it involves using ICT to transform business processes. The successful implementation of such systems and related services requires careful management and measurement. To gain deeper insights into the present state of information systems (IS) and digital services in higher education and relevant theory-based models, a systematic literature review and bibliometric analysis were conducted. After the search and screening, this paper systematically reviewed 63 publications to identify various ISs and classify the research conducted to date. This paper highlights a critical gap in the investigation of ISs beyond learning activities, emphasizing the under-researched area of administrative digital services. Furthermore, the paper contributes by highlighting the prevalent use of DeLone and McLean's success model, particularly in combination with TAM/UTAUT, for empirically measuring IS success in higher education. Results also identify a need for greater consistency and rigor in the use of indicators across studies, since there is no evident agreement on indicators used for measuring the success dimensions. Bibliometric analysis on 1791 records underscores the evolving research landscape, with a shift towards evaluating the quality dimension emphasizing the significance of success evaluation. By achieving its primary objective of examining and organizing the relevant scientific literature on IS in higher education, this study contributes to the existing body of knowledge and offers foundational resources researchers and HEIs seeking to implement new ISs or improve their current systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The literature on risk in family firms has grown rapidly in recent decades, and an analysis of its evolution and current state is therefore both timely and useful. Accordingly, we review 291 articles published between 1992 and 2022 and combine bibliometric and qualitative analyses to map and make sense of the field. In particular, we systematize the growing literature on risk in family firms by identifying its conceptual structure, theoretical roots, and thematic areas. In addition, we derive factors of heterogeneity − perspective of analysis, aspects of risk, role of the family − within risk in family firms’ studies. In doing so, we take stock of the literature, shed light on the multiple facets of risk, develop an interpretative framework of current knowledge, and offer a guide to advance this flourishing research field. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - The continuous challenges to which family firms are subjected have led research in this field to focus on various aspects, thus generating a large and heterogeneous body of literature. This paper describes the evolution, status, and trends in family business literature over the decade 2012–2022 and also identifies gaps that may require further investigation. In that regard, new opportunities for additional analyses are also determined. To this end, a bibliometric study has been carried out based on a collection of articles from the Business Source Premier, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, yielding a total of 4064 articles. We analyze the main indicators of activity in family business research over the aforementioned period. The most productive authors and institutions, leading journals, and main research topics of these publications are reflected in this analysis. Likewise, the relationships between the most frequent co-authorships within the field are mapped, as well as the connections between co-words in published articles. In addition, the 10 most influential works published during those 10 years and changes in trends related to the most popular topics, in contrast to previous years, are also highlighted. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Climate change poses a significant threat to global food security, and a comprehensive understanding of its impact on agricultural production is needed. We analysed the Scopus data set between 1993 and 2023. China occupies the leading position in terms of climate change production, and the United States occupies the comprehensive strength position with the largest citation strength output. Notably, a substantial 29% annual publication increase between 2000 and 2015 was noted. Despite prevailing research on specific facets, a pronounced gap exists in global-scale studies focusing on the direct impact of climate change on agricultural production and yield, with a predominant concentration in regional analyses. Collaboration in this area continues to occur within developed nations, but the rate of growth at the international level is relatively low. In addition, the frequency of co-occurrence analysis of keywords revealed that climate change and sustainability are the focal keywords, but yield, food security, irrigation and rice production have yet to be identified. The results of this research will help in designing a policy for water resource management for irrigation planning and an adaptative food security management strategy and provide a feature research guide. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The imperative need of this hour is to measure the influence of high-performance work system (HPWS) research and comprehend its patterns as HPWS became more prevalent in service- oriented businesses. Underscoring this, authors aim to shed light on the publication trends and set the future research schema in the arena of HPWS with special reference to the service sector context. The study adopts a bibliometric approach as authors intend to identify and analyse the research breadth of HPWS research in the service context across the world, so that a statistical and analytical comprehensive overview of the research and suggestions for future directions can be provided. A portfolio of 262 articles was extracted from the Scopus database and various bibliometric techniques were used to analyse the collected research articles using "R"programming with biblioshiny web interface. The bibliometric results revealed the dynamics of research trends in HPWS service context studies, the most influential publications, authors, sources, the most productive countries, and affiliations. The citation analysis revealed the most cited scientific publications, and the countries from which most citations were received. Likewise, the thematic analysis revealed the underlying themes and patterns of HPWS service context studies that emerged with time. In such ways, this study contributes to the literature by depicting the intellectual landscape of HPWS research in the service context, that will be useful to the researchers, academicians, practitioners, policy makers and funding agencies.  © 2024 World Scientific Publishing Co.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to outline the current state of empirical research on banks' risk reporting. In addition to the development of the research field over time, regulatory trends and drivers for academic research on risk reporting will be derived. The review follows a triangulated approach: In addition to a qualitative content analysis based on the SLR, a quantitative bibliometric analysis using the scientific visualization techniques bibliometrix and VOSviewer will serve as a robustness check. The sole focus of this SLR on banks reflects the regulatory specificity of the financial services industry and serves to derive recommendations for action for regulators, supervisors, and auditors. The article follows the tenor of macro- and micro-prudential banking regulation, which has raised market discipline to a new level through the implementation of regulatory disclosure standards in the context of the Basel III amendment, with a deliberate clustering of the research area according to risk types. By identifying research gaps and conceptualizing a research agenda, this paper continues to serve the academia to broaden the research field of risk disclosure, especially for banks. © 2023

AB  - Broiler product quality has become essential in marketing strategies in the global scientific research landscape. This research aims to explore the latest findings in scientific research on the quality of broiler chicken products and analyze their implications for marketing performance. The bibliometric analysis method was applied in this research using the Scopus database as a data source, focusing on the keywords "broiler" and "marketing" in the article title. This approach allowed the identification of 19 relevant documents, which were then analyzed comprehensively. Key findings from the analysis show increasing research interest in the marketing of broiler products over time, underscoring the importance of marketing strategies in the industry. Understanding the factors influencing product quality and marketing performance is essential in marketing. The implication for marketing performance is that a better understanding of the factors influencing product quality, such as heat stress management, industry regulations, feed management, and nutritional supplementation, can help manufacturers develop more effective marketing strategies. In addition, these findings also highlight the importance of further research that focuses on the role of retailers in the broiler product supply chain. This can improve understanding of distribution strategies and consumer perceptions, significantly contributing to the development of the broiler industry in a dynamic market. © 2024, Unique Scientific Publishers.

AB  - Energy finance has grown rapidly and attracted considerable attention for the increasing interactions between energy and financial industries. However, the scope and boundary of energy finance are still unclear due to the diversity of emerging research topics. Therefore, this paper provides a profile of energy finance conducting bibliometric analysis from four dimensions: the intellectual base, research trajectories, intellectual communities, and research fronts. This paper analyzed 10,961 related articles sourced from Web of Science (WOS) since 1904 through three bibliometric analysis approaches: co-citation network analysis, main path analysis and bibliographic coupling analysis. We find that research of energy finance has experienced three stages and can be categorized into five themes: “energy and financial market”, “pricing mechanisms of energy”, “energy derivative markets”, and “green finance”. Furthermore, through retrospective and co-citation analyses of the recent literature, we identify six research frontiers: “stock markets and energy prices”, “exchange rate and energy market systemic risk modeling”, “financial policies related to sustainability and low carbon”, “climate and the state of the carbon emissions trading market”, “crude oil price forecasting and future market”, and “energy infrastructure investment and financing”. These findings contribute to the systematic research and an overall mapping of energy finance. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: The Ventral Hernia Working Group (VHWG) proposed a ventral hernia grading guideline, primarily supported by expert opinion, recommending biologic mesh placement in high-risk patients. We investigated the relationship between this industry-sponsored guideline and discourse around ventral hernia repair (VHR). Methods: Medline platform from Web of Science’s database identified publications “pre-VHWG”(1999-01-01 to 2009-12-31), and “post-VHWG”(2010-01-01 to 2020-12-31) describing VHR and complications or recurrence of VHR with the following comorbidities: COPD, smoking, diabetes, immunosuppression, or obesity. Poisson regression analyzed keyword frequency over time using logarithmically transformed data. Results: Of 1291 VHR publications identified pre-VHWG and 3041 publications identified post-VHWG, 172 (13.3%) and 642 (21.1%) publications respectively included prespecified keywords. The keyword groups “biologic”(IRR 3.39,95%CI1.34-11.4,p = 0.022) and “comorbid”(IRR 1.95, 95%CI1.09-3.74,p = 0.033) significantly increased with frequency after publication of the VHWG. Conclusion: The VHWG publication likely contributed to a focus on comorbidities and biologic mesh in the ensuing literature within the field of VHR. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: The Journal of Engineering Education (JEE) is a leading academic journal that serves to cultivate, disseminate, and archive scholarly research in engineering education. Bibliometric analysis has been gaining considerable interest from the scientific community in recent years. However, to the best of our knowledge, bibliometric analysis was not employed to analyze the publications of JEE. Purpose: In recognition of JEE's 111 years of publication, this paper uses bibliometric analysis to provide a retrospective journal overview. This study analyzes the publication characteristics, influence, and collaborative relationship of JEE. It also provides data for the development of future research. Method: A total of 1251 articles of JEE were retrieved from Scopus database for our bibliographic analysis using VOSviewer (Van Eck and Waltman, Scientometrics 2010; 84(2):523–538). The search was performed in mid-November 2021 using the term “Journal of Engineering Education” in the “Publication Titles” field, yielding 1379 documents between 1969 and 2021. We excluded editorials and notes and only included articles, reviews, and conference papers. Results: JEE has increasing contribution and influence within empirical engineering research publications regarding the quantity and the quality/citations of its published articles. The top contributing institutions are mainly from the United States. Major themes identified include knowledge acquisition and skill development, diversity and inclusion, engineering research and assessment, engineering learning mechanisms, and instrument and measurement. Conclusions: Emerging technologies and challenges provide new research topics and directions for JEE. Additionally, this study uncovers certain research gaps that JEE—to increase contributions and influence—can identify as growth areas. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The publication trend related to reading comprehension studies in the last decade has sharply grown. Nevertheless, studies offering comprehensive bibliometric and bibliographic reviews related to reading comprehension studies have not been conducted nor also found in the journal or conference proceeding. The purpose of this study is to present a bibliographic and bibliometric review of the numerous documents studying reading comprehension skills. A bibliometric analysis was performed to carry out this study whereby 1,681 eligible documents from the Scopus database published from 2013 to 2022 were used as research materials. Results showed that in 2013-2022, the publication trend of reading comprehension studies slightly increased while the citation trend on the documents regarding reading comprehension skills tended to fall sharply. Additionally, at least there were several major emerging themes of reading comprehension studies such as methodology, language, educational level, reading disability, reading intervention, reading comprehension predictor, and moderating factor of reading comprehension. This study implies that researchers in the field of Indonesian language education can focus on the utilization of Indonesian textbooks in investigating learners’ reading comprehension skills, develop innovative and effective reading interventions to enhance learners’ reading comprehension skills, and explore some other moderating factors of reading comprehension skills such as ethnicity, culture, geographical location, and textbook topic. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - Over the past decades, there has been an increase in the awareness of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). This study analysed the research activities on electro-catalysts for DMFCs from 1992 to 2023 using bibliometric analysis. This was achieved by extracting the relevant data from web of science (https://www.webofknowledge.com), and retrieved data were analysed by using the Rstudio software. A total of 1912 documents were recovered from this database. Rstudio outputs were annual scientific production, most productive authors, top manuscripts per citations, corresponding author’s countries, total citations per country, most relevant sources, most relevant keywords, and research collaboration index. It was observed from the retrieved data that there is an increase in publications of research on electro-catalysts for direct methanol fuel cells from 1992 to 2020. A huge drop was observed from 2021 to 2023. The data provided a documents per author of 0.408 and authors per document of 2.45. It is observed that collaboration index is 2.48. China, USA, and Korea are the top 3 countries in both total citations and countries with most articles in this field. This study is of great help in informing communities, researchers, policy makers, and industries about the importance of DMFC development in providing alternative power source. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Introduction. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of patients requiring wound care. The attention is on the time required for wound healing and the growing risk of antibiotic resistance. The 2022 Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) report highlights alarming resistance rates among common bacterial pathogens. Thus, it is important to emphasize new alternative methods of wound care to address antibiotic resistance. Metal-based nanoparticles, such as copper nanoparticles (CuNPs), are a promising material for tissue regeneration and preventing the development of antibiotic resistance of microorganisms. The aim is a bibliographic analysis of data on the use of copper nanoparticles as an antimicrobial agent for wound healing (and for other medical purposes). Materials and methods. The authors searched for information in electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using the main keywords. Tools for bibliometrics network visualization (VOSviewer) were used in the analysis. Results. We studied 142 publications in the Scopus database, where the main keywords were “copper nanoparticles” and “wound healing”. The results show that over the past 14 years, the number of publications on the research topic has begun to increase. The subject is mostly studied by researchers from China, India, and the USA, which indicates the relevance of the current subject among the scientists. From 2010 to 2024, a bibliometric analysis on the Scopus database identified four chronological stages based on keywords: 1) synthesis of copper nanoparticles and description of the antimicrobial properties; 2) antibacterial activity in wound healing; 3) inception of new biomaterials to wound care. Thus, copper nanoparticles and their properties are actively studied. The ability of CuNPs to inhibit bacterial growth and promote angiogenesis can be used in wound healing and added to dressings to stimulate tissue regeneration. © A. S. Butsyk, R. A. Moskalenko, 2024.

AB  - Gender inequalities pervade Ghana, with a lot of studies focusing on them. However, little has been documented about gender inequalities in water research in the country. This article seeks to contribute to the existing knowledge by providing empirical evidence of the nature of gender inequality in water research and calls for improving gender-based studies in water research institutions in the country. Known for its research activities on water resources, the Water Research Institute (WRI) of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) is taken as a case. Therefore, the study specifically addresses these questions: (i) does water research of the WRI include gender and gender-related topics (ii) what is the representation of women researchers in the WRI? (iii) what existing gender inequalities impact women researchers’ contributions to knowledge production in the WRI? The study adopted a mixed method approach combining questionnaire survey, phone interviews, and document review to generate primary and secondary data to address the research concerns. Although the WRI produced articles within the 10-year studied period, the bibliometric analyses showed that none of them discussed topics related to gender. The lack of integration of gender issues in water research skewed water knowledge towards only water's chemical/biophysical aspects. Also, women research scientists were fewer than their male counterparts, with these women researchers experiencing gender-related discrimination and intimidation. As a government institution, it is recommended that the WRI considers integrating gender topics in its research activities to generate knowledge that informs better water policy formulation and hence, benefits all including women and girls in the country. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose of Review: A bibliometric analysis was performed to analyze and compare the top 100 articles from the most well-known five pain journals: Pain, Pain Physician, Pain Medicine, Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine, and Journal of Pain. A query of the Scopus database was performed to filter the top 200 most cited articles from each journal. CY score was calculated for the top 200 articles from each journal by dividing the total number of citations by the number of years the article has been published. Recent Findings: All articles had a collective analysis of the top CY scores, the top 100 of which were further analyzed. The pain subtype, type of publication, country of origin, and senior author were extrapolated from these top 100 articles. Frequency tables were organized, revealing Pain Journal as the highest publishing journal out of the top 100 articles. Summary: Chronic pain was the most studied subtype of pain and narrative reviews were the most common type of evidence. Studies were also organized in five-year epochs to analyze the frequency of publications in these intervals. Results show that 2010-2014 had the highest frequency of articles published overall. Journal Impact Factor (JIF) is also an objective indicator of the average number of citations per published article from each journal. The journal with the highest JIF was Pain with an impact factor of 7.926. (6) © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: Oral finasteride and topical minoxidil formulations are the only FDA-approved drug therapies for androgenetic alopecia (AGA). Research into dutasteride, topical finasteride, and nontopical minoxidil (low-dose oral and sublingual) formulations in the treatment of AGA has spiked within recent years. Early findings show that these alternative drug therapies may have similar to improved efficacy and safety profiles relative to the conventional treatment options. Aims: Conducting a bibliometric analysis, compare trends in publications on these alternative drug therapies, identify key contributors, evaluate major findings from top-cited articles, and elucidate gaps in evidence. Methods: A search was conducted on the Web of Science database for publications on the use of alternative drug therapies in the treatment of AGA. A total of 95 publications, published between January 2003—March 2024, and their citation metadata were included in the analysis. Results: Dutasteride showed the greatest (n = 37) and longest (20+ years) history of publications, as well as the highest cumulative citations (n = 914); however, nontopical minoxidil showed a burst in research activity within the last 5 years (n = 33 publications since 2019). A relatively low number of randomized control trials (n = 3) for nontopical minoxidil suggests a need for higher-quality evidence. Conclusions: Our analysis reveals major trends, contributors, and gaps in evidence for alternative drug therapies for AGA, which can help inform researchers on their future projects in this growing field of study. There is enthusiasm for exploring off-label formulations: nontopical forms of minoxidil (oral and sublingual), topical finasteride, and mesotherapy. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - The Circular Economy is now the focus of attention in various sectors, and many international organisations, such as FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO, are showing great interest in the issue (FAO, 2021). In the 2030 agenda published by the UN in 2015, specifically SDG 2 says ‘End hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture’. Hence, research on the application of Circular Economy methods in agriculture has become increasingly relevant. The main objective of this study was to analyse the evolution of this line of research and identify current trends linking Circular Economy and Agriculture and identify the drivers in this area of study. A bibliometric analysis of the articles produced in the period 2005–2020 was therefore carried out. The results show, in an irrefutable manner, that this topic is increasingly gaining visibility and relevance, that coincides with the establishment of the SDGs. The analysis of the key words highlighted three main lines of research: sustainability and sustainable development, as the eco-sustainable management of agricultural processes; bioenergy, produced from waste or agricultural production; life-cycle assessment, methods for calculating the environmental and health impacts of agricultural production processes. Interest in the Circular Economy depends on the awareness on the topic shown by each country. This is also reflected in the research. The regions where studies on Circular Economy and Agriculture are mainly carried out are Europe, Asia, North and South America, while Russia, Africa, the Middle East and Oceania still suffer from a certain gap. The situation of studies limited to Circular Economy applied to organic agriculture was also briefly analysed, and it was pointed out that in recent years many researchers have turned towards this field of research. Many studies tend to show that organic farming is the only primary activity that allows environmentally sustainable production and consumption. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.

AB  - This research used bibliometric method to analyze the development characteristics of PEMFC during the past 10 years from 2014 to 2023. The results show that the number of articles related to PEMFC in both the CNKI database and the WOS database has a steady growth trend. The top 20 units in terms of the number of articles in the CNKI database were universities and scientific research institutions, and the Wuhan University of Technology came first. In the WOS database, the number of papers published, the number and ranking of highly cited papers, and the in-depth analysis index and ranking of cited references from China were all first. China has the largest cumulative number of papers published (5926 papers in total, accounting for 41.6% of the total number of papers published in this field in the past 10 years), occupying the core position in the international cooperation network, and the quality of papers published by European and American countries was relatively high; keyword cluster analysis has shown that the proton exchange membrane, catalyst, gas diffusion layer, membrane electrode, and cost of PEMFC were the current research focus. Therefore, the development trend of PEMFC key materials was analyzed in detail in this study. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - This paper conducted a systematic review of Scopus-indexed publications on large language models (LLMs) and natural language processing (NLP) extracted in October 2023 to address the dearth of literature on their opportunities and challenges. Through bibliometric analysis, from the 1,600 relevant documents, the study explored research productivity, revealing both opportunities and challenges spanning research and real-world applications in education, medicine, and health care, citations, and keyword co-occurrence networks. Results highlighted distribution patterns and dominant players like Google LLC and Stanford University. Opportunities such as technological development in generative artificial intelligence (AI), were contrasted with challenges such as biases and ethical concerns. The intellectual structure analysis revealed prominent application areas in health and education and also emphasized issues such as AI divide and human-AI partnership. Improvement on the technology performance of LLM and NLP remains to be a challenge. Recommendations include further exploration of open research problems and bibliometric studies using other research databases given the research bias towards Scopus-indexed English publications. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - Background: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been widely used as a life support for different kinds of acute cardiopulmonary dysfunction. The present study aimed at presenting the global trend of the top 100 cited original studies related to ECMO. Methods: Bibliometric analysis was the primary methodology for this study. Literature data were collected from Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). Indicators were analyzed and visualized by Excel and VOSviewer, the study design, study population, study topic, journal impact factor (IF), Category Rank and Category Quartile, author, country, journal and keywords were included. Results: The top 100 cited articles were published between 1979 and 2021. With 19 publications, 2020 was the most prolific year. High-income countries or regions, such as the United States of America (USA), France and Canada owned a majority of the articles. Seventeen studies were randomized trials, 52 were finished in single center, and 53 focused on adults. The 100 articles were documented by 31 different journals. The journals were well recognized, with a mean IF2022 of 28.77, a median of 8.8, and a range of 1.6–168.9. The major diseases were viral infection of respiratory system, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or respiratory failure, pulmonary hypertension of infants, heart failure/cardiogenic shock, diaphragmatic hernia and cardiac arrest. Specifically, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) accounted for 72.7% of viral infections. The disease spectrum changed from congenital cardiopulmonary dysfunction to cardiac arrest, ARDS and cardiopulmonary failure, and to severe COVID infection cases. Another fresh hotspot is immune dysfunction. Conclusions: This bibliometric analysis identified 100 most frequently cited original studies on ECMO and described their characteristics, which may help with further investigations. © AME Publishing Company.

AB  - Virtual, augmented, and mixed reality, known collectively as extended realities (XR), have the potential to transform businesses but research service is required. This report explores the productivity of XR-related in business research. This paper has enhanced the traditional bibliometric approach by integrating it with a mathematical supplement, Expedited Analytical Hierarchy Process (EAHP). This enhanced methodology allows for a nuanced evaluation of research service productivity and offers direction for future research efforts. Productivity is evaluated in terms of the effectiveness and efficiency of research results, so creating a bibliometrics index for commenting on research effectiveness and evaluating research efficiency criteria from a publication standpoint, the work added to the field. Analysis of the collected scientometrics data show the field is not yet optimally productive, leading to a call for increased focus on future research. Besides, the utilization of EAHP's systematics way to convert the data into a future research direction, with mixed reality found to require more attention than other XRs. A complementary literature analysis step highlights the practical application of XRs in business and the growing importance of the XR-owned worlds, metaverses. As a result, this study found evidence to argue that the services provided by the business research community are not optimally productive when dealing with the XR movement, and it calls for more attention to support businesses. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) refers to methods and tools that facilitate communication for individuals with limited functional speech. This study aims to present and analyse the research status of AAC interventions for children with special needs in mainland China using a bibliometric analysis approach. The researcher conducted a literature search in the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database to identify relevant studies. Based on the literature search, 80 articles met the inclusion criteria. The research literature spans from 2007 to 2022, with a notable increase in publications after 2015. The majority of studies focus on children with autism, while other disabilities, such as intellectual disabilities and cerebral palsy, receive less attention. AAC interventions primarily utilize low-technology communication aids, with limited use of high-technology tools. Research on AAC interventions for children with special needs in mainland China has grown recently. However, it still falls short of meeting the potential demand to promote the application and development of AAC. More diverse research is needed, including various disabilities and higher-technology AAC tools. The effectiveness of AAC in impacting users and their communication partners will increase their quality of life and social interactions. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Reliability engineering faces many of the same challenges today that it did at its inception in the 1950s. The fundamental issue remains uncertainty in system representation, specifically related to performance model structure and parameterization. Details of a design are unavailable early in the development process and therefore performance models must either account for the range of possibilities or be wrong. Increasing system complexity has compounded this uncertainty. In this work, we seek to understand how the reliability engineering literature has shifted over time. We exe cute a systematic literature review of 30,543 reliability engineering papers (covering roughly a third of the reliability papers indexed by Elsevier's Engineering Village. Topic modeling was performed on the abstracts of those papers to identify 279 topics. The hierarchical topic reduction resulted in the identification of eight top-level method topics (prognostics, statistics, maintenance, quality control, management, physics of failure, modeling, and risk assessment) as well as three domain-specific topics (nuclear, infrastructure, and software). We found that topics more associated with later phases in the development process (such as prognostics, maintenance, and quality control) have increased in popularity over time relative to other topics. We propose that this is a response to the challenges posed by model uncertainty and increasing complexity. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - This research offers a comprehensive view of the constructs of sustainable energy from the perspective of consumer behavior. It aims to identify the theories, consumption modes, and methods used, and to correlate the main contributions of selected primary studies. To this end, a systematic literature review was carried out, consisting of three main phases: planning, conducting, and reporting. The study adhered to the PICOC guidelines (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Context) to structure the review. A literature search across six databases led to the analysis of thirty-one primary studies. These studies were selected using the StArt tool, based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among these criteria, a quality assessment was highlighted, evaluating four aspects: the alignment of the primary studies with the review and three aspects related to bibliometric data, including the publication venue and the number of citations. The results reveal that the concept of sustainable energy differs from renewable energy and is divided into two categories: renewable sources and functionalities. This study proposes five dimensions to categorize the constructs: environmental, technical, economic, social, and institutional. The theories that most influenced behavior in favor of sustainable energy include socio-psychological, cognitive, and normative beliefs. Future research should focus on the integration of technology and renewable energy sources to promote sustainable energy, ensuring its effective and economically viable operation, regardless of external factors. Understanding approaches, theories, and modalities related to sustainable energy consumption can contribute to the establishment of new strategies to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The publication trend regarding multicultural education studies has been increasing in three last decades. Nevertheless, systematic studies providing comprehensive bibliographic and bibliometric review related to this issue has not been performed nor also reported in the electronic journals or conference proceeding. A systematic review combined to bibliometric analysis was used to present global trends and future directions in educational researches related to multicultural education. 284 eligible documents from Scopus database published in 2001–2023 were involved as the data. Results revealed that in the period of 2001–2023, publication trend of multicultural education studies slightly soared while citation trend on the documents regarding multicultural education studies relatively fluctuated. The productive and influential documents, authors, countries, institutions, and sources contributed most to the development of multicultural education studies. Moreover, a lot of authors and institutions in the world jointly worked and also generated research networking in conducting the studies of multicultural education, mainly authors come from United States and educational institutions located in United States. Additionally, at least there are several major emerging themes related to multicultural education studies such as methodology, learning environment, main topic in multicultural education, affective and cognitive domain, participant, and theoretical framework. The future researches related to this topic should develop valid, practical, and effective learning models for multicultural competence referring to culturally responsive transformative teaching approach. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - Background: Osteoporosis is a common metabolic disorder that significantly impacts quality of life in the elderly population. Macrophages play a crucial role in the development of osteoporosis by regulating bone metabolism through cytokine secretion. However, there is a lack of scholarly literature in the field of bibliometrics on this topic. Objective: This study provides a detailed analysis of the research focus and knowledge structure of macrophage studies in osteoporosis using bibliometrics. Methods: The scientific literature on macrophage research in the context of osteoporosis, retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database spanning from January 1999 to December 2023, has been incorporated for bibliometric examination. The data is methodically analyzed and visually represented using analytical and visualization tools including VOSviewer, CiteSpace, Scimago Graphica, the Bibliometrix R package, and Pajek. Results and Conclusions: In the last quarter-century, there has been a consistent rise in the quantity of scholarly publications focusing on the relationship between macrophages and osteoporosis, resulting in a total of 1499 research documents. These studies have originated from 45 different countries, with China, South Korea, and the United States being the most prominent contributors, and the United States having the highest frequency of citations. Noteworthy research institutions involved in this field include Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Wonkwang University, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and Seoul National University. The Journal of Bone and Mineral Research is widely regarded as the premier and most frequently referenced publication in the field. These publications involve the collaboration of 8744 authors, with Lee Myeung Su contributing the most articles, and Takayanagi being the most co-cited author. Key emerging research focal points are encapsulated in keywords such as “mTOR,” “BMSCs,” “bone regeneration,” and “exosome.” The relationships between exosome from macrophage sources and those from BMSCs, along with the regulatory role of the mTOR signaling pathway on macrophages, represent crucial directions for future development in this field. This study represents the inaugural comprehensive bibliometric analysis detailing trends and advancements in macrophage research within the osteoporosis domain. It delineates recent frontiers and hotspots, providing valuable insights for researchers in this particular area of study. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is a proven treatment for many psychological disorders. It has been extensively studied and is effective for anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. However, a bibliometric analysis of the CBT literature for these disorders is needed. This study reviewed this field's research and identifies key trends, influential studies, and gaps. Methods: Using MeSH-generated keywords and PRISMA guidelines, the Scopus database retrieved bibliographic data without temporal or geographical constraints. Data-driven studies were analyzed for performance, collaborative pattern, impact, co-word frequency, knowledge structure, and trending topics using R-package-based Bibliometrix and VOSviewer applications. The current study applied bibliometric and statistical analyses. Results: Scopus yielded 2757 studies since inception in 1979. The polynomial regression coefficient of 0.945 (R2) indicates a strong positive trend, and the research has increased at an annual rate of 12.67 %. Scholars from five countries had a noteworthy production of CBT research in treating PsD, namely the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and the Netherlands. Depression, oppositional defiant disorder, schizophrenia, and implementation are the clusters in the CBT research map. The thematic map needed to meet the desired criteria for representing all anticipated themes. Thematic evolution is evidence of noticeable changes that contributed to the creation of new research clusters and the disappearance of some of them. COVID-19 has significantly impacted the adoption and efficacy of internet-based interventions for mental health. The cross-sectional study provides valuable insights into the development and dissemination of CBT in Saudi Arabia, emphasizing the importance of training, awareness, and research. Conclusions: This study proposes that further investigation be conducted in contemporary literature to create a comprehensive framework for enhancing policy decisions regarding CBT. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - In the digital age, the reading habits are gradually declining and poor reading skills are causing various informational and social challenges include lack of critical thinking and intellectual irresponsibility. The main objective of this study is to consolidate the published works to comprehend the influencing factors of reading culture. We examine the reading skills, reading habits and reading behaviour literature from 1991 to 2020 to measure the scope and depth of reading culture (RC) through bibliometric analysis and visualisation by utilising a VOSviewer software based on Web of Science database. These selected 1139 articles are classified according to year of publication, author, the country of publications and author affiliation. The analysis provided insights about the RC publication trends as the most productive years are 2017 and 2019. The United States, Spain and China are the leading countries contributing to reading culture-related publications. Jyväskylä University and Florida State University serve as the most productive institutions. Furthermore, we also conduct a thematic analysis based on the keywords to identify the components and influencing factors contributing to the reading culture. The four main components of the reading culture are identified as reading skills, behaviour, habits and factors. At the end, we provided propositions to support the reading culture and future research directions for the interest of Library and Information Science (LIS) professionals, academicians and researchers. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Phytoremediation has become a sustainable solution for mitigating cesium-137 (Cs-137) contamination and has been implemented in areas affected by the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear disasters. Despite the absence of nuclear power plants in Indonesia, incidents of Cs-137 contamination have been reported in Batan Indah Housing Complex, emphasizing the need for effective decontamination techniques. The aim of this study was to analyze the bibliometric characteristics of research works on phytoremediation in addressing Cs-137 contamination during the last ten years (2013–2022) by foreign and Indonesian authors. This research is important both globally and in specific contexts, such as Indonesia, particularly in the context of policy and practical applications. For example, when facing issues like Cs-137 decontamination in the BATAN Indah area, the research can have local relevance and contribute to solving immediate problems. This study utilized the Scopus database and retrieved 2,123 article titles within this topic over the last decade. Several indicators were used to examine the publications: productivity of authors, collaboration between countries, top-cited articles, keywords analysis, and publication trends. The results show that the number of publications fluctuated over previous decade with an average publications age of 5.54 years. Onda Y from the University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan become the most prolific and collaborative author. Japan being the most productive and collaborative country, while Indonesia ranked 42nd with only 9 publications regarding the topics. The bibliometric analysis provides a foundation for understanding the development of science on this topic and uncovers that there is still plenty of space to conduct phytoremediation research in Indonesia, especially for Cs-137 contaminated soils, which have increased over the years. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The trucking industry urgently requires comprehensive methods to evaluate driver safety, given the high incidence of serious traffic accidents involving trucks. The concept of a “truck driver persona” emerges as a crucial tool in enhancing driver safety and enabling precise management of road transportation safety. Currently, the road transport sector is only beginning to adopt the user persona approach, and thus the development of such personas for road transport remains an exploratory endeavor. This paper delves into three key aspects: identifying safety risk characteristic parameters, exploring methods for constructing personas and designing safety management interventions. Initially, bibliometric methods are employed to analyze safety risk factors across five domains: truck drivers, vehicles, roads, the environment, and management. This analysis provides the variables necessary to develop personas for road transportation drivers. Existing methods for constructing user personas are then reviewed, with a particular focus on their application in the context of road transportation. Integrating contemporary ideas in persona creation, we propose a framework for developing safety risk personas specific to road transportation drivers. These personas are intended to inform and guide safety management interventions. Moreover, the four stages of driver post-evaluation are integrated into the persona development process, outlining tailored safety management interventions for each stage: pre-post, pre-transit, in-transit, and on-post. These interventions are designed to be orderly and finely tuned. Lastly, we offer optimization recommendations and suggest future research directions based on safety risk factors, persona construction, and safety management interventions. Overall, this paper presents a safety management-oriented research technology system for constructing safety risk personas for truck drivers. We argue that improving the design of the persona index system, driven by big data, and encompassing the entire driver duty cycle—from pre-post to on-post—will significantly enhance truck driver safety. This represents a vital direction for future development in the field. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper is the first to offer a comprehensive literature review of the role of evolutionary psychology (EP) in marketing and consumer behavior. This study takes a holistic approach, combining techniques of a systematic review with bibliometric analysis, to provide a performance analysis and identify theories and methodologies used in the literature. Most importantly, by studying the current state of EP, we elucidate six major themes: the role of gender in families, the role of affect in consumer behavior, food preferences and shopping behavior, motivations for and consequences of status signaling, the impact of ovulation on consumer motives and behaviors, and contributions to the greater good. The findings enable researchers to understand the current state of the literature. Further, to advance the application of EP in consumer behavior, we identify gaps related to each theme and offer research questions that can serve as catalysts for future research. Thus, we offer two primary contributions: a comprehensive overview of the literature as it relates to methods, theories, and themes and detailed guidance that can be used to invigorate research on EP. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Despite continual advancements in total joint arthroplasty and perioperative optimization, there remains national variability in outcomes. These outcome variabilities have been in part attributed to racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare quality and access to care. This study aims to identify arthroplasty racial and ethnic disparities research and to predict future hotspots. Methods: Ethnic and racial disparities articles between 1992 and 2022 were queried from the Web of Science Core Collection of Clarivate Analytics. Bibliometric indicators in excel format were extracted and subsequently imported for further analysis. Bibliometrix and VOSviewer analyzed current and previous research. Results: Database search yielded 234 total articles assessing racial and ethnic disparities between 1992 and 2022. Twenty-six countries published manuscripts with the United States producing the majority of publications. The Veterans Health Administration and University of Pittsburgh were the most relevant institutions. Ibrahim SA was the most relevant and influential author within this field. Visuals of thematic map and co-occurrences identified the basic, motor, and niche themes within the literature. Conclusions: Racial and ethnic disparity within arthroplasty literature demonstrate growing traction with global contributions. United States authors and institutions are the largest contributors within this field. This bibliometric analysis identified previous, current, and future trends for prediction of future hotspots. © 2024

AB  - In recent decades, climate change and other environmental threats have driven growing interest in the value of ecosystem services, particularly for communities reliant on mangrove forests. This study utilized a bibliometric analysis of 1222 academic papers on 'mangrove' and 'ecosystem services' published between 1998 and 2023. Data from the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases were analyzed using VOSviewer and the Bibliometrix R package to gain comprehensive insights. Based on citation frequency, the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom were the top countries contributing to research in this field. Analysis of keywords revealed a focus on 'mangrove,' 'ecosystem services,' 'ecosystem,' 'conservation,' and 'forests.' In contrast, the author keywords highlighted emerging themes like 'blue carbon,' 'climate change,' and 'wetland.' 'Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science' and 'Ocean and Coastal Management' were leading journals in this domain, reflecting the strong presence of multidisciplinary research. Notably, only one of the top ten journals, 'Ecosystem Services,' belongs to the social sciences. Trend analysis suggested evolving research interests, with recent studies focusing on 'mangrove conservation,' 'restoration,' and 'community,' compared to earlier emphases on 'mangrove' and 'ecosystem services' around 2019. Thematic mapping further underscored this dynamism, with ecosystem services emerging as a rapidly expanding multidisciplinary field. Notably, the thematic evaluation revealed a shift in focus, with ecosystem services and mangroves transitioning from fundamental to motor themes. This bibliometric analysis offered valuable insights into current research trends, fostered understanding within a multidisciplinary context, and paved the way for future studies in this critical field. The study underscored the importance of focusing future research on mangrove ecosystem services, particularly in gaining support from policymakers for evidence-based policies. It emphasized the need for transdisciplinary studies to assess the impacts of ecosystem services and conservation policies. It also highlighted a crucial gap in the literature regarding the sustainability of mangrove ecosystem services, suggesting the integration of economic, environmental, and engineering approaches for more effective policy initiatives. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article presents a systematic review and bibliometric analysis of research linking the inter-organizational business network and innovation research. It also discusses previous research on the subject and identify gaps for future studies. A review was done using the dimensions database. This was undertaken using specific keywords search in the title, abstract, and keywords of papers. The review revealed that the research in the field is growing fast. In fact, the paper has established that the UK, the US, and Italy respectively, have dominated publications in terms of the most influential countries for research in the field of inter-organizational business networks. The content review of papers showed that the papers were mainly trying to address the phenomena (the antecedents, management of the network, and network performance outcomes). These categories are not mutually exclusive but would help us to organize the fragmented literature on the topic. This article reviews and discusses the empirical literature on inter-organizational innovation networks and shows that the field is highly fragmented. While some areas have gained considerable research attention, others have experienced a relative paucity of research, and thus topics for future research are discussed. © 2023 KJ Somaiya Institute of Management.

AB  - Aim: Screenings make it possible to detect anomalies that can be treated and identify patients who require referral to a specialist. The objective is to identify the different areas of research and determine the most cited publications on screening in primary care. Methods: An analysis of publications and visualization of citation networks has been carried out using the Citation Network Explorer software. The bibliographic search was carried out with the Web of Science (WOS) database using the search term: “screening AND (vision OR eye OR ocular OR visual)”. Results: We analyzed 16707 publications in all fields, 23919 citation networks have been found. The number of publications has increased, with 2021 being the year with the highest number. The majority are scientific articles and the predominant language is English. The most cited article is a global meta-analysis on the prevalence of glaucoma, showing the importance of screening for its early detection since it is essential to avoid blindness. Using the clustering function we found 8 groups with a significant number of publications where we have bibliography on certain eye diseases: glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, pediatric amblyopia, keratoconus and dry eye. Conclusions: The main areas of study in relation to screening are the detection of diseases such as glaucoma, retinopathy of prematurity, keratoconus and dry eye. As well as the detection through visual analysis of childhood amblyopia and vision loss in elderly patients. It also gives importance to performing ocular motility tests in problems of acquired brain damage. © 2024 Sociedad Española de Médicos de Atención Primaria (SEMERGEN)

AB  - Sustainable tourism is a dynamic, complex system in which continuous interaction between economic, social, and environmental components will take place. The complexity of the system occurs because of nonlinear interactions between these components. Further, in a dynamic condition, econometric models based on historical data will not provide a realistic solution. However, the plan towards achieving tourism sustainability is mostly based on the past behaviour of heterogeneous factors and assumes that these factors will behave in the same way in the future as well. This approach is inefficient for understanding the underlying structure of the complex system and fails to address the issue of sustainability in a feasible way. Therefore, the present study addresses the issue of sustainable tourism using a system dynamic approach for Mussoorie, India. The results of the study reveal that the existing tourism policy is more in favour of enhancement of tourism at the cost of degrading air quality through increase in carbon emissions, loss of water spring bodies, increase in noise pollution, over exploitation of natural resources and reflecting the myopic approach of the existing policy. This study confirms that the existing approach will emasculate the objective of sustainable tourism. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.

AB  - Introduction: Oral antifungals were the earliest treatments to receive approval for the management of onychomycosis and have a long-standing record to support their efficacy. Topical antifungals and device-based treatments have been explored and some implemented in more recent years as alternatives to traditional oral antifungals. The present bibliometric analysis summarizes trends in publication frequency for onychomycosis treatment modalities over time and characterizes their body of literature in terms of types of studies available and relative level of evidence. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed using Web of Science and SCOPUS databases. Results: Covering all publications from 1970 to present day, our search identified oral therapeutics n = 295 articles (n = 63 randomized control trials [RCTs]), topical therapeutics n = 358 articles (n = 72 RCTs), and device-based treatments n = 158 articles (n = 37 RCTs). Spikes in research activity surround FDA approval of therapeutics for each treatment modality. Research activity within the last decade has focused on topical and device-based treatments. Evidence for efficacy of devicebased treatments is lacking from relatively few highquality RCTs. Conclusion: With growing concern for non-dermatophyte mold onychomycosis and terbinafine resistance, researchers should validate the efficacy and safety of device-based treatments with high-quality studies.  © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) plays an essential role within buildings, impacting health, well-being and productivity, considering that individuals spend much of their daily lives indoors. Providing these individuals with a comfortable environment is an important issue. Through a literature review in the Scopus database, one thousand seven hundred and ten articles were identified, of which seventy-eight were selected based on the criteria established. Then, studies on IEQ models were investigated using bibliometric, mapping and hierarchical cluster analysis. The main conclusions of this research are: (I) bibliometric analysis revealed the existence of ninety-five indoor environmental quality models; (II) twelve aspects were identified: tangible aspects (usually measured by an equipment), encompassing thermal comfort, indoor air quality, acoustic comfort and visual comfort; and intangible aspects (mainly obtained by subjective responses via questionnaire), including biophilia and exterior views, cleaning and maintenance, personal control, layout and furniture, location and amenities, colors and textures, friendly atmosphere and pleasure at work; (III) mapping analysis revealed that the indoor air quality aspect is predominant in the models selected; (IV) hierarchical clustering formed five clusters, grouping the aspects thermal comfort and indoor air quality aspects in the same cluster; (V) the visualization of models highlighted the multidisciplinary nature of the indoor environmental quality concept, comprising physiological, psychological and social aspects. These results contributed to verifying the current state of the art and identifying future trends, highlighting a gap related to intangible aspects in the models. Also, improving IEQ by considering occupant behavior can help reduce energy consumption inside buildings. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease, with an increasing prevalence worldwide, but its pathomechanisms remain incompletely understood. Accumulating evidence suggests that immunity plays an important role in the development of DN. Many papers have been published in the field over the last 20 years, but there has been no bibliometric review of the research hotspots and trends in the field. This study aimed to assess the current research status and future trends of the link between immune and DN using bibliometric analysis. Methods: Publications on the association between immunity and DN from 2004 to 2023 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database and screened according to inclusion criteria. VOSviewer and CiteSpace software were employed to visualize research trends and hotspots in the field. Data including author, institution, country, journal, reference, and keyword were analyzed. Results: Ultimately 1246 publications meeting the criteria were included in the bibliometric analysis, involving 838 articles (84.96%) and 408 reviews (15.04%). The literature covered 81 countries and regions, 1751 institutions, and 6584 authors. The top 2 countries in terms of the number of publications were China (435) and the United States (318), and they collaborated most frequently. The United States had the highest number of citations for published papers (18,161), far exceeding the other countries. England had 38 publications but had the highest average number of citations (92.32). The University of California system was the most prolific institution (25 papers, 1062 citations, 42.48 citations per paper). Frontiers in Immunology was the most prolific journal in the field (30 papers). The most cited journal was Kidney International (863 citations). The analysis of keywords and references showed that inflammation, ferroptosis, and lipid metabolism may be future research hotspots in this field. Conclusions: The number of publications related to immunity and DN has increased annually over the past 20 years, with a significant increase in the last 3 years especially. Our results identified research hotspots and trends in the field. These findings provide valuable perspectives for future research, enhancing our understanding of the immune-related mechanisms of DN and exploring potential therapeutic strategies. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Objectives: To explore research hotspots and theme trends in artificial intelligence in nurse education using bibliometric analysis. Design: Bibliometric analysis. Data sources: Literature from the Web of Science Core Collection from the time of construction to October 31, 2023 was searched. Review methods: Analyses of countries, authors, institutions, journals, and keywords were conducted using Bibliometrix (based on R language), CiteSpace, the online analysis platform (bibliometric), Vosviewer, and Pajek. Results: A total of 135 articles with a straight upward trend over the last three years were retrieved. By fitting the curve R2 = 0.6022 (R2 > 0.4), we predicted that the number of annual articles is projected to grow in the coming years. The United States (n = 38), the National University of Singapore (n = 16), Professor Jun Ota (n = 8), and Nurse Education Today (n = 14) are the countries, institutions, authors, and journals that contributed to the most publications, respectively. Collaborative network analysis revealed that 32 institutional and 64 author collaborative teams were established. We identified ten high-frequency keywords and nine clusters. We categorized the research hotspots of artificial intelligence in nurse education into three areas: (1) Artificial intelligence-enhanced simulation robots, (2) machine learning and data mining, and (3) large language models based on natural language processing and deep learning. By analyzing the temporal and spatial evolution of keywords and burst detection, we found that future research trends may include (1) expanding and deepening the application of AI technology, (2) assessment of behavioral intent and educational outcomes, and (3) moral and ethical considerations. Conclusions: Future research should be conducted on technology applications, behavioral intent, ethical policy, international cooperation, interdisciplinary cooperation, and sustainability to promote the continued development and innovation of AI in nurse education. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Learning Space is the physical and psychological place of acquiring knowledge, which has evolved significantly, influenced by technological advancements, pedagogical shifts, and changing student needs. The transformation of learning spaces is crucial for fulfilling the needs of the 21st generation learners and improving the learner’s overall outcome. This study aims to explore the available literature on learning spaces to analyse the past, current and future trends of study themes, in learning spaces, through a bibliometric analysis approach. Vos viewer software is used to determine the author, countries, and publications, which have made the greatest contribution to learning spaces research, as well as the key themes and emerging trends of study. The findings of the study show that most of the learning space research is focused on the user experience in traditional and digitally equipped learning spaces, the impact of learning spaces on users’ cognition, attitude, engagement, performance and well-being, and the design of innovative learning spaces. Still, there is a lack of research on the design and utilization of spaces to satisfy the needs of the 21st-century digital generation, for the well-being of the learner, and improvement of learning outcomes. The emerging theme of research is focused on the learner’s mental, physical and social well-being. This study will help the researchers to understand the research gap in the field of learning space research. © Italian e-Learning Association.

AB  - Background: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a potential mechanism contributing to tumorigenesis, metastasis, recurrence, and drug resistance. The objective of this study is to investigate the status quo and advancements in CSC research utilizing bibliometric analysis. Methods: Publications related to CSCs from 2010 to 2022 were collected from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Various analytical tools including CiteSpace, VOSviewer, Scimago Graphica, and GraphPad Prism were used to visualize aspects such as co-authorship, co-occurrence, and co-citation within CSC research to provide an objective depiction of the contemporary status and developmental trajectory of the CSC field. Results: A total of 22,116 publications were included from 1942 journals written by 95,992 authors. Notably, China emerged as the country with the highest number of publications, whereas the United States exerted the most significant influence within the field. MD Anderson Cancer Center emerged as the institution making the most comprehensive contributions. Wicha M.S. emerged as the most prolific and influential researcher. Among journals, Cancers emerged as a focal point for CSC research, consistently publishing a wealth of high-quality papers. Furthermore, it was observed that most journals tended to approach CSC research from molecular, biological, and immunological perspectives. The research into CSCs encompassed a broad array of topics, including isolation and enrichment techniques, biomarkers, biological characteristics, cancer therapy strategies, and underlying biological regulatory mechanisms. Notably, exploration of the tumor microenvironment and extracellular vesicles emerged as burgeoning research frontiers for CSCs. Conclusion: The research on CSCs has garnered growing interest. A trend toward multidisciplinary homogeneity is emerging within the realm of CSCs. Further investigation could potentially center on the patients of extracellular vesicles and the tumor microenvironment in relation to CSCs. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Federación de Sociedades Españolas de Oncología (FESEO) 2024.

AB  - Purpose: Heated discussions have divided health care providers and policymakers on the risks versus benefits of general anesthesia in pediatric populations. We conducted this study to provide a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of general anesthesia in this specific population over the past decade. Design: We summarized and quantitatively analyzed the studies related to general anesthesia in children and infants over the past decade. Methods: Using the Web of Science Core Collection as the data source, we analyzed the literature using CiteSpace software, focusing on authors, countries, institutions, keywords, and references to identify hotspots and predict research trends. Findings: A total of 2,364 publications on pediatric anesthesia were included in the analysis. The number of related publications and citations steadily increased from 2013 to 2022. The United States was the leading country in terms of output, and University of Toronto was the primary contributing institution. Co-citation analysis revealed that over the past decade research has mainly focused on the long-term adverse effects of general anesthesia on neurodevelopment and acute perioperative crisis events. Keyword analysis identified infant sedation and drug selection and compatibility as promising areas for development. In addition, improving the quality of perioperative anesthesia will be a major research focus in the future. Conclusions: Recent research in pediatric anesthesia has focused on mitigating the adverse effects of general anesthesia in infants and young children and studying the pharmacological compatibility of anesthetics. Our study results would assist researchers and clinicians in understanding the current research status and optimizing clinical practice in this field. © 2024 The American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses

AB  - Background: Disruption score (DS) is a novel bibliometric created to identify research that shifts paradigms, which may be overlooked by citation count (CC). We analyzed the most disruptive, compared to the most cited, literature in vascular surgery, and hypothesized that DS and CC would not correlate. Methods: A PubMed search identified vascular surgery publications from 1954 to 2014. The publications were linked to the iCite NIH tool and DS algorithm to identify the top 100 studies by CC and DS, respectively. The publications were reviewed for study focus, design, and contribution, and subsequently compared. Results: A total of 56,640 publications were identified. The top 100 DS papers were frequently published in J Vasc Sur (43%) and Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg (13%). The top 100 CC papers were frequently published in N Engl J Med (32%) and J Vasc Sur (20%). The most cited article is the fifth most disruptive; the most disruptive article is not in the top 100 cited papers. The DS papers had a higher mean DS than the CC papers (.17 vs.0001, P <.0001). The CC papers had a higher mean CC than the DS papers (866 vs 188, P <.0001). DS and CC are weakly correlated metrics (r =.22, P =.03). Discussion: DS was weakly correlated with CC and captured a unique subset of literature that created paradigm shifts in vascular surgery. DS should be utilized as an adjunct to CC to avoid overlooking impactful research and influential researchers, and to measure true academic productivity. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The presence of macroplastic (MP) is having serious consequences on natural ecosystems, directly affecting biota and human wellbeing. Given this scenario, estimating MPs' abundance is crucial for assessing the issue and formulating effective waste management strategies. In this context, the main objective of this critical review is to analyze the use of machine learning (ML) techniques, with a particular interest in deep learning (DL) approaches, to detect, classify and quantify MPs in aquatic environments, supported by datasets such as satellite or aerial images and video recordings taken by unmanned aerial vehicles. This article provides a concise overview of artificial intelligence concepts, followed by a bibliometric analysis and a critical review. The search methodology aimed to categorize the scientific contributions through temporal and spatial criteria for bibliometric analysis, whereas the critical review was based on generating homogeneous groups according to the complexity of ML and DL methods, as well as the type of dataset. In light of the review carried out, classical ML techniques, such as random forest or support vector machines, showed robustness in MPs detection. However, it seems that achieving optimal efficiencies in multiclass classification is a limitation for these methods. Consequently, more advanced techniques such as DL approaches are taking the lead for the detection and multiclass classification of MPs. A series of architectures based on convolutional neural networks, and the use of complex pre-trained models through the transfer learning, are currently being explored (e.g., VGG16 and YOLO models), although currently the computational expense is high due to the need for processing large volumes of data. Additionally, there seems to be a trend towards detecting smaller plastic, which need higher resolution images. Finally, it is important to stress that since 2020 there has been a significant increase in scientific research focusing on transformer-based architectures for object detection. Although this can be considered the current state of the art, no studies have been identified that utilize these architectures for MP detection. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In recent years, SI initiatives have emerged as a promising approach to addressing pressing social and environmental challenges. However, despite their proliferation and potential benefits, the evaluation frameworks for assessing their impact effectively are often lacking. This gap in the current literature on SI impact evaluation is further compounded by fragmentation, with limited established frameworks or methods for evaluating the impact of SI initiatives. To address this research gap, we conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of 185 studies published in the Web of Science database from 2008 to 2023. Our rigorous analysis revealed significant research gaps and identified four thematic areas related to the development of evaluation frameworks, including collaboration and co-creation in impact evaluation of SIs, comprehensive and context-specific approaches to evaluating SI initiatives, financial factors in SI impact evaluation, and technology acceptance and SI impact. Through a content analysis of these thematic areas, our study provides key insights into the current state of research on SI impact evaluation and identifies potential avenues for future research. The findings of our study contribute to a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with SI impact evaluation and offer valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers working in this area. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - Dioxin-like compounds, recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as among the most enduring toxic chemical substances in the environment, are linked to various occupational activities and industrial accidents worldwide. The aim of this study was to examine and present research publications on dioxins, pinpoint current research trends, identify research gaps, and highlight potential avenues for future exploration in the field. The study period for relevant research articles ranged from 1923 to December 31, 2022, and these articles were sourced from the Scopus database. The analysis involved the identification of key contributors to the field and the visualization of topics, themes, and international collaboration. VOSviewer software (version 1.6.20) was used for visualization analysis. A total of 11,620 publications on dioxins were documented in the Scopus database. The predominant category of these documents comprised 9780 original articles, which represents 84.17% of the total publications. The United States lead in the number of publications, with 3992 (34.35%), followed by Japan, with 1429 (12.3%), China, with 1005 (8.65%), and Germany, with 974 (8.38%). Before 2002, scholarly attention in this field focused primarily on the health effects, environmental fate, and mechanism of toxicity of tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). However, a noticeable change in research focus has been observed since 2002, highlighting the emergence of a topic related to the health effects and environmental fate of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PFDFs). This study is the first to conduct a comprehensive quantitative bibliometric analysis of dioxins over time. These findings indicate a significant increase in the overall growth of the dioxin literature over the past 30 years. These findings may prove crucial in guiding and organizing subsequent investigations related to dioxins. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background/purpose: Lichen planus (LP) is a representative mucocutaneous disease involving oral mucosa and skin. The aim of this study was to compare the scientometric characteristics of LP publications in stomatology and dermatology journals. Materials and methods: All the papers on LP were comprehensively searched and then ones published in stomatology and dermatology journals were retrieved. Results: Among all the 5633 papers on LP, 1344 (23.9%) and 2528 (44.9%) were published in stomatology and dermatology journals, respectively. Among the most-cited top-100 papers, 58 and 30 were published in stomatology and dermatology journals, respectively. Moreover, citation count (11,908) and citation density (640.2) of the 58 stomatology publications were obviously higher than the 2 numbers (5096, 260.3) of the 30 dermatology publications. Based on the frequency of research keywords, the distinctive keywords such as malignant transformation, precancerous, genetics, genotype, gene expression, saliva, blood, cytokines, smoking, anxiety, and depression were identified in stomatology publications. On the other side, hyperkeratosis, hyperpigmentation, erythema, epiluminescence microscopy, and dermoscopy were identified in dermatology publications. Furthermore, drug research including drug withdrawal, drug safety, and drug dose reduction with a dozen of drugs are frequent keywords in dermatology but not in stomatology publications. Conclusion: The distinctive keywords of LP publications in stomatology and dermatology journals correspond to the research priority in stomatology and dermatology. We hope that the observations of this analysis will aid clinicians and investigators in promoting mutual understanding and more reciprocal cooperation regarding LP in stomatology and dermatology. © 2023 Association for Dental Sciences of the Republic of China

This study aims to examine the trends and developments in OLV research from 1982 to 2024 through bibliometric analysis. Methods: The literature on OLV was systematically searched in the Web of Science Core Collection database for this study. VOSviewer and CiteSpace were utilized to perform comprehensive bibliometric and visual analyses of global publication/trends, countries/institutions, authors/co-cited authors, journals/co-cited journals, co-cited references, and keywords in the field of OLV. Results: A total of 1,682 articles and reviews on OLV research were identified, which showed an overall growing trend from 1982 to 2024. The United States was the leader in this field, accounting for the largest number of publications (n=299). Among all institutions, Yonsei University had the largest number of publications (n=23), but National Taiwan University Hospital had the highest number of cited publications (n=876). The papers related to OLV were mainly published in Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (n=147) and the most productive author was Cheng YJ (n=15). After keywords analysis, “infants”, “dexmedetomidine”, “inflammation”, and “airway management” were newly emergent research hotspots. Conclusions: Through bibliometric and visualization methods, we undertook a comprehensive analysis in the field of OLV. The United States maintained a top position in this field, the emerging hotspots of OLV changed from basic research to clinical research and the further innovation of OLV management. This study provides new ideas for scholars in their future works. © AME Publishing Company.

The research landscape is shown to be highly responsive to international policy developments, increasingly adopting interdisciplinary approaches that integrate physical, social, and technological dimensions. Findings reveal a robust emphasis on geospatial analysis and the development of various indices that transform abstract climate risks into actionable data, underscoring a trend towards localized, context-specific vulnerability assessments. Based on dataset systematically curated under the PRISMA guidelines, the review explores how prevailing research themes are reflected in influential journals and author networks, mapping out a dynamic and expanding academic community. Moreover, this work provides critical insights into the underlying literature by conducting a thematic analysis on the typology of studies, the focus on coastal areas, the inclusion of climate change scenarios, the geographical coverage, and the types of climate-related hazards. The practical implications of this review are profound, providing policymakers and practitioners with meaningful insights to enhance climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts through the application of index-based methodologies. By charting a course for future scholarly endeavours, this article aims to strengthen the scientific foundations supporting resilient and adaptive strategies for regions worldwide facing the multifaceted impacts of climate change. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Background & objective: The extensive spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide has caused a dramatic negative impact on many individuals' health. This study aims to systematically and comprehensively analyze the current status and possible future directions of diabetes mellitus (DM) and COVID-19 research. Methods: We obtained publications about COVID-19 and DM from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) using the search terms "COVID-19″ and similar terms combined with “DM” and similar terms, with a date range of January 2020 to May 2024. And we used CiteSpace V 6.3.R2 to perform the bibliometric visualization analysis. Results: The search enrolled 6266 publications. The USA is a country with the most publications; Harvard University was the most productive institution in this field. The highest-ranked journal was the PLOS ONE, and the most cited journal was Lancet. The 20 most cited journals have all been cited 28754 times, accounting for 28 % of the total cites; the range of those journals was 790–3197. Publications on COVID-19 and DM research exhibited a distinct trajectory, shifting from an initial emphasis on understanding the impact of diabetes on COVID-19 infection and its associated pathophysiological mechanisms to a focus on analyzing the differential responses of diverse patient populations. Subsequently, research has progressed to examine the effects of medications and vaccines, as well as the long-term consequences of COVID-19 in diabetic individuals. Throughout this research endeavor, the exploration of diverse therapeutic interventions, their efficacy, and ultimate outcomes have consistently remained a paramount focus. And “ metabolic syndrome,” " long COVID," and “ gestational diabetes” are still likely to be the hotspots and frontiers of research in the future. Conclusions: This bibliometric analysis related to DM in COVID-19 illuminates the current research situation and developmental trends, supporting researchers in the exploration of prospective directions for research. © 2024 The Authors

Various studies have systematically examined scholarly research on MOOCs. However, the reviewed academic publications on the use of MOOCs in engineering education are limited. Purpose/Hypothesis(es): This study aims to examine the implementation of MOOCs in engineering education using systematic review and bibliometric analysis methods. Design/Method: This study examines 68 studies from the Web of Science database that fall within the scope of the systematic review and 257 studies for bibliometric analysis. Results: Since 2018, there has been a growing number of studies exploring the uses of MOOCs in engineering education. The quantitative research method is the most preferred, while the mixed method is the least preferred. The study found that using MOOCs in engineering education resulted in positive student perceptions and satisfaction. However, the lack of interactivity between learners and instructors or among learners was the most frequently reported problem. Moreover, the bibliometric analysis indicates that reviewed studies extensively explore learners' engagement, interactions, and feedback processes. Recently, academic research focused on sentiment analysis, deep learning, educational technology, machine learning, and text mining. Conclusions: There is a need for further investigation into utilizing MOOCs in engineering education. This study's evaluation of MOOCs' pros and cons yields essential insights for optimizing their use in engineering education. By leveraging the positive aspects outlined in the study, educators can enhance engineering students' satisfaction and participation in MOOCs. These findings offer a valuable resource for researchers exploring MOOC-related topics in engineering education. © 2024 American Society for Engineering Education.

AB  - Sustainable investing and financing play a central role in achieving sustainable development goals. Using high-quality articles from the Scopus database, this study deploys bibliometric analysis followed by content analysis on 528 and 33 articles to synthesise the academic literature on sustainable investing and financing published between 2012 and mid-2022 and analyse the field's evolution and progress in research. The performance analysis identifies the field's most influential studies, and the conceptual and intellectual structures shed light on foundational themes and research progression. An in-depth content analysis identifies and reveals novel insights on three primary research themes: financing sustainability, asset returns, and sustainable outcomes. The key issues encompass investor motivations and investment performance of sustainable investments compared to conventional investments, challenges, and policy enablers that aid the development of sustainable financing and sustainability outcomes. The study also offers future research directions and concisely summarises research using the theories-context-characteristics-methods framework. The findings will help further theory development in academic research on sustainable investing and financing and have practical implications for investors, issuers, and regulators. Investors can gain insights into the performance of sustainable investments, issuers can understand the benefits of adopting sustainable finance, and regulators can obtain insights into the policy enablers that would result in more efficient outcomes. The limitation of the study is that it is qualitative and does not quantify factors or models that lead to sustainable development. © 2024 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - PI3K-AKT-mTOR plays as important role in the growth, metabolism, proliferation, and migration of cancer cells, and in apoptosis, autophagy, inflammation, and angiogenesis in cancer. In this study, the aim was to comprehensively review the current research landscape regarding the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in cancer, using bibliometrics to analyze research hotspots, and provide ideas for future research directions. Literature published on the topic between January 2006 and May 2023 was retrieved from the Web of Science core database, and key information and a visualization map were analyzed using CiteSpace and VOSviewer. A total of 5800 articles from 95 countries/regions were collected, including from China and the USA. The number of publications on the topic increased year on year. The major research institution was the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Oncotarget and Clinical Cancer Research were the most prevalent journals in the field. Of 26,621 authors, R Kurzrock published the most articles, and J Engelman was cited most frequently. “A549 cell,” “first line treatment,” “first in human phase I,” and “inhibitor” were the keywords of emerging research hotspots. Inhibitors of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and their use in clinical therapeutic strategies for cancer were the main topics in the field, and future research should also focus on PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway inhibitors. This study is the first to comprehensively summarize trends and development s in research into the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in cancer. The information that was obtained clarified recent research frontiers and directions, providing references for scholars of cancer management. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The frequent occurrence and diverse nature of black swan events in recent years, has stimulated explosive growth in studies on different types of uncertainties. We propose the concept of multi-source uncertainty (MU) and systematically synthesize 2230 high-quality articles (2000−2023) extracted from Web of Science via bibliometric analysis. With the help of performance analysis and science mapping analysis, we find that: (1) MU research has gone through three stages, preparation stage (2000–2007), rising stage (2008–2015) and take-off stage (2016–2023). (2) MU research is undertaken across a wide range of disciplines from Economics to Environmental Science, from Meteorology to Business Finance and from Computer Science to Political Science. (3) The intellectual structure of MU research consists of a methodological basis for the measurement of uncertainty and its effects and a theoretical basis for the impact of uncertainty on corporate finance, economic activity, and asset pricing. (4) Four major themes have been investigated by current literature, namely, "Environmental uncertainty and adaptation", "Uncertainty nexus and commodity volatility forecasting", "The impact of uncertainty on corporate finance", and "The effects of uncertainty shocks on financial markets". (5) The keywords at the three stages show a rapid growth trend, with more diversified sources of uncertainty and increasingly rich research topics. Among them, "geopolitical risk", "volatility forecasting", "climate policy uncertainty", "economic policy uncertainty", "economic uncertainty", and "COVID-19", are currently the hottest keywords. Overall, we present recent research trends, gaps, and future research agendas in this domain, which will help policy-makers, regulators and academic researchers know the nuts and bolts of the MU research, and identify the relevant areas that need investigation. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - The majority of research on corporate entrepreneurship focuses on developed countries and overlooks that various cultural and economic contexts may lead to different intensities and behaviors in entrepreneurial activities. This omission could challenge extant theoretical models and assumptions. Accordingly, this article intends to analyze the literature on corporate entrepreneurship in developing countries. The paper adopts a two-step research approach, a systematic literature review, and a bibliometric (co-word analysis) analysis of 85 articles published between 1999 and 2021. We identify the major articles, journals, and scholars that made significant contributions to the field within the context by summarizing and describing indicators, such as number of publications, citations, theoretical and methodological perspectives, topic trends, and thematic maps. Analysis enables the study to establish that research on corporate entrepreneurship in developing countries comprises three major thematic classifications, namely, determinants and effects of corporate entrepreneurship; determinants of intrapreneurship and performance, and dynamic capabilities and corporate entrepreneurship. In summary, this article contributes to an enhanced understanding of the concepts and dimensions of corporate entrepreneurship within developing countries. In addition, it provides a research agenda; hence, we propose future directions that shape the dynamics of the field and that provide relevant insights for researchers and managers interested in corporate entrepreneurship in the context of developing countries. © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

AB  - This research aims to map the development of quality management research indexed in Google Scholar and analyze topics related to this topic. By adopting a qualitative descriptive method, it was carried on through three stages: (1) indexed journal with the help of Google Scholar PoP (Publish or Perish) software; (2) journals were saved as an RIS (Research Information System) file; and (3) bibliometric analysis was performed using VOS viewer. This search focused on articles discussing quality management topics in the period 2010–2023, with a limit on the number of documents of 900. The research results showed that the amount of research on quality management had fluctuated. The most publications occurred in the specified year range, namely 83 articles. The topics most discussed were quality management systems, performance, top management, education, total quality management, relations, and improvement, while those that were still very few were distance education, skills, conflict management, competence, social development, information management, and career adaptability. Therefore, these topics were likely to be of concern to the latest research on quality management in the future because there was still very little research on them. © 2024, SCAD Independent Printed in Indonesia.

AB  - Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative tumor with low incidence and complex symptoms, affecting patients' quality of life and shortening their life span. Since the beginning of the 21st century, there has been an update but a need for uniform consensus regarding diagnosing and treating PV. With the continued interest of researchers in this field, a bibliometric study of PV is necessary. This paper aims to analyze articles on PV through bibliometric software to provide collaborative information and new ideas for researchers in this field. We collected PV-related publications in the Web of Science Core Collection database from 2000 to 2023. The included literature was analyzed using Citespace (6.2.R2), VOSviewer (1.6.19), and Bibliometrix. The study included country/region, institution, authors, journals, keywords, and references, and a visual knowledge network diagram was constructed. Microsoft Excel 2013 was also used for statistical analysis. A total of 1,093 articles were eventually included. The number of PV-related publications has steadily increased from 2000 to the present, with great potential for future growth. The US and US institutions have contributed more to this field, with the US ranking first in the number of publications, total citations, and centrality. Alessandro M. Vannucchi is the most published author. Tefferi, Ayalew is the most cited author. And BLOOD has the most publications, topping the list of the eleven high-productivity core source journals. The most cited article was "Acquired mutation of the tyrosine kinase JAK2 in human myeloproliferative disorders" (Baxter, EJ, 2005). By examining the keywords, we found that the diagnosis and typing of true erythrocytosis, the use of ruxolitinib, and the tyrosine kinase JAK2 are the research hotspots in the field; genetic and molecular research in the field of true erythrocytosis is a cutting-edge topic in the field; and risk factors for true erythrocytosis is a cutting-edge hotspot issue in the field. The fruitful research in this century has laid the foundation for developing the field of PV. The information in this article will provide researchers with current hotspots and future potential in the discipline, helping the field achieve more extraordinary breakthroughs. Currently, research should focus on increasing global multicenter collaborative research in diagnosis and treatment to develop scientifically recognized diagnostic and treatment protocols and new clinical drug research. Our proposed model of global innovation collaboration will provide strong support for future research. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Statement of problem: Scientific collaboration provides a suitable strategy for enhancing the exchange of knowledge and technological development. However, the impact of collaboration in oral implantology research between countries and how it has been influenced by the income status of the country has not been previously evaluated. Purpose: The purpose of this bibliometric analysis was to evaluate how collaboration between countries affected oral implant publications and whether patterns of collaboration differ depending on the country's income. Material and methods: Articles were retrieved from 7 well-established journals whose scope included oral implantology at 5 time points (1999, 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2019). Data were extracted, and descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed (α=.05). Results: A total of 1944 articles were included; of which, 27.5% presented collaboration between countries. In 2009, 2014, and 2019, collaboration between countries was more likely to occur than at previous time points (P≤.005). Corresponding authors with a higher h-index (P<.05) and authors from Europe and North America (P<.001) were more likely to establish international connections. The possibility of collaboration between countries was higher for animal studies (P<.001) and for articles published by Clinical Oral Implants Research (P=.026). Collaborations between high-income and upper-middle– or lower-middle–income countries were more likely to happen in 2014 and 2019 (P<.05), as well as when the number of authors was higher (P=.015), compared with collaboration between high-income countries. With regard to the continent, European articles were less likely to have collaborations with upper-middle– or lower-middle–income countries (P<.001). Conclusions: The findings revealed that some parameters related to the study, authors, countries, and journals were statistically associated with the presence of collaboration between countries. However, the bibliometric parameters showed different trends when countries of different incomes established collaboration. © 2022 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry

AB  - Net zero carbon (NZC) retrofitting of existing buildings contributes to improving occupants' well-being, addressing carbon footprint directly and is key to solving the global climate crisis. However, a fragmented NZC retrofit knowledge base exists and this challenges the ability to effectively implement NZC practices. This study, therefore, integratively and comprehensively reviews existing literature on NZC retrofitting of existing buildings and identifies research gaps to provide future research directions. Bibliometric analysis was conducted using 1544 relevant articles identified from Scopus. Moreover, based on 125 carefully selected articles, a further qualitative analysis was also conducted. Results indicated a gradual increase in interest in NZC retrofitting research since 2007. Emergent findings reveal that the UK, Italy, US, China and Spain are the top five countries in this research field and that in NZC retrofitting, energy is mostly prioritised. Key research themes include NZC retrofitting benefits, challenges and measures. Based on identified knowledge gaps, future research directions are proposed to include: (1) analysis of NZC retrofitting measures based on building types and climate conditions; (2) integration of NZC retrofitting measures; (3) effects of occupants' health, well-being and satisfaction on retrofitting; (4) integration of modern technology; (5) quantitative study on benefits; and (6) dealing with objections to NZC retrofitting. Emergent findings generate an in-depth understanding of the NZC retrofitting field and provide a useful milestone reference for future NZC retrofitting practice and improvement in the industry. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Green finance, which includes climate finance, is a highly relevant issue for climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as for the transition to a renewable and sustainable energy economy. However, it constitutes a diverse and multi-layered field whose contents and interrelationships are not easily tangible and which lacks a widely accepted definition. Using quantitative bibliometric methods, this article analyzes a dataset of 942 peer-reviewed articles on green finance and their 37,255 references. It provides a structured and objective overview of the nine main research streams, their prevalence over time, high-impact publications, and the degree of information exchange between them. The main streams of green finance research address different levels of analysis, focus on a range of topics from several scientific fields, and arguably evidence little intellectual exchange. Based on the findings, it is suggested how future research on green finance can coalesce across disciplines to increase its productivity and efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: The construction industry is one of the most dangerous, with daily dangers and hazards. The industry commonly employs Safety I, a reactive approach to reduce accidents and incidents by identifying and controlling hazards. Safety II focuses on using worker strengths and promoting ongoing improvement. Nevertheless, both Safety I and II have faced criticism for their excessive emphasis on regulatory compliance (Safety I) and executive constraints (Safety II), respectively. Hence, this paper presents a rich synthesis of Safety I and II literature in the construction industry between January 2000 and December 2023 prior to proposing strategies for integrating them to build a safer future by focusing on the strengths of implementing each technique. Methodology: In this scientometric research study, 35 related research papers were sought and selected after checking and validating the Web of Science journal database. Bibliometric analysis, through HistCite and VOSviewer software programmes, was then used to create maps from network data and illustrate an exploration of the prevailing literature discourse. Interpretivism was then used to develop application and combination strategies for the new theory of integrating Safety I and II in the construction industry. Findings: Results reveal that the historical progression of research undertaken has developed from first introducing and identifying the field of research (2011 to 2015) to then providing solutions (2015 to 2019) and finally to making constructive suggestions (post 2019) for a safer future. Notably, prominent topics in recent years have examined resilience and progress toward safety improvements by the combination of Safety I and II concepts. Originality: This research highlights the positive outcomes that can be achieved via Safety I and II integration in the construction industry. Furthermore, this paper offers efficient and pragmatic techniques for incorporating Safety I and II approaches in the construction industry, which are crucial for promoting a comprehensive integrated approach to safety administration. By combining existing safety practices with a focus on learning from successes, organisations can create a safer work environment, improve productivity and foster continuous improvement. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Rhizodeposition plays a crucial role in the soil carbon (C) cycle, yet a comprehensive understanding of global research trends and directions related to rhizodeposition remains elusive. To provide a global perspective, this study employs bibliometric analysis to systematically review research on the Soil C cycle-rhizodeposition (SCC-Rhizo) publication characteristics, topic trends, and knowledge domains over the past decades. The SCC-Rhizo documents (2598) from 1966 to 2023 in the Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus were analyzed using VOSviewer, CiteSpace software and ‘bibliometrix’ package of R. A significant rise in annual publications and international scientific collaboration has been observed over the past years, indicating substantial growth potential and a dynamic research landscape. The study topics varied and flourished over time. The research scope expands from small-scale lab simulations to encompass large-scale ecosystem studies in diverse environments (i.e. grasslands, forests and paddy fields). The composition of rhizodeposition has been scrutinized from general compounds to specific materials (such as organic acids), while interactions between rhizodeposition and soil are currently being explored at the molecular level, which is expected to be a focal point of future research. Beyond bacteria, investigations now encompass fungi, microbial activity, and microbial communities. Isotope labeling and metagenomics sequencing are increasingly prevalent technology in SCC-Rhizo research. The results provide a global, objective perspective for understanding SCC-Rhizo research over the past decades. This research underscores the necessity for future studies to accurately quantify the rates and composition of rhizodeposition at the ecosystem level, explore the interactions with soil components, and develop predictive models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - After World War II, Berlin was divided into the West, controlled by The United States, the UK, and France, and the East, controlled by the Soviet Union, resulting in a Cold War for decades. This bibliometric study analyzes the influence of the Cold War on pharmacological research in Berlin by evaluating publication patterns in Naunyn-Schmiedeberg’s Archives of Pharmacology from 1947 to 1974 (n = 383). The publications highlight the political disparities in scientific output, exacerbated by the founding of the Free University of Berlin (FUB) as a countermeasure to Soviet repression, promoting academic freedom in West-Berlin. Researchers in West-Berlin published many more papers in Naunyn-Schmiedeberg’s Archives of Pharmacology than researchers in East-Berlin and received much more citations. West-Berlin adopted English as a scientific language much more rapidly than East-Berlin. West-Berlin and East-Berlin focused on totally different research topics. This paper demonstrates how political freedom, financial support, and internationalization boosted research productivity in West-Berlin. In contrast, political suppression, financial scarcity, and restricted international ties hindered scientific development in East-Berlin. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Intelligence has always been a key factor in people’s assessments of leaders and has featured on most profiles of leadership traits and competences. However, the disparate nature of research on intelligence in leadership studies means that it is time to take stock and to consider what has been learned. We do this by reporting a bibliometric analysis of published scholarly work on intelligence as it relates to leadership. The article begins with a short narrative review of intelligence in leadership studies before 1991, which demonstrates the long history of intelligence being conceptualized as IQ, general intelligence, wisdom, and intellect. This is followed with a bibliometric analysis of the topic from 1991 to 2022, which demonstrates how emotional intelligence has become the primary focus of leadership intelligence scholars. The implications of this shift of scholarly attention are discussed at the end of the article. In addition, we discuss the implications for implicit leadership theory (ILT) and demonstrate that the intelligence attribute in ILT frameworks is underdeveloped. © 2023 Fortune Institute of International Business.

AB  - The ongoing economic development trajectory has precipitated an environmental crisis by endorsing an unsustainable paradigm of urban ecological development, thereby engendering a concerning disjunction between Urban Development and the preservation of natural resources. This study undertakes a meticulous examination, characterized by systematic review and bibliometric analysis, to unearth critical perspectives, recognize primary contributors, and provide a repository of high-caliber information to researchers. This investigation systematically identifies scholarly works aligned with Ecological Footprint and Urban Development themes through a comprehensive exploration of esteemed academic databases, including Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. Subsequently, the amassed data undergoes scrupulous analysis employing advanced methodologies, encompassing graph theory and specialized tools such as bibliometrix, Sci2 Tool, and Gephi. The findings are judiciously categorized into three distinct typologies: ‘classic,’ ‘structural,’ and ‘recent,’ thereby illuminating three perspectives: sustainable urban development, sustainability indicators, and water policy and the clean economy. Notably, it is paramount to underscore the substantive influence of Chinese research in this domain, with Zhang Yan emerging as the principal author. Furthermore, this research underscores contemporary trends in the field, most notably the burgeoning interdisciplinary approaches aimed at comprehensively assessing the environmental ramifications associated with urban development. Future research endeavors are poised to fortify predictive models, thereby facilitating a profound comprehension of diverse urbanization scenarios, focusing on green infrastructure. Additionally, scholars are expected to increasingly align their work with global policies, exemplified by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). © 2024 Ecological Society of China

AB  - Quorum sensing (QS) plays a pivotal role in bacterial interactions and is crucial for enhancing the efficiency and stability of biological wastewater treatment (BWT) systems. However, the diversity of BWT processes and the complexity of QS pose challenges to understanding their functionality. This review uses bibliometric tools to synthesize research from the past two decades, capturing the significant growth in research in this field driven by China, Korean, and U.S. researchers. The research hotspot has shifted from initial basic research on 'gene expression' and 'biofilm formation' to applied studies on 'start-up', 'denitrification', 'nitrification', and 'temperature', along with interdisciplinary explorations. Keyword cluster analyses reveal key themes, including quorum quenching, biofilm formation, membrane fouling, and antibiotic resistance genes. Subsequently, this review explores current applications and mechanisms. Enhanced QS promotes pollutant removal through modulation of microbial metabolism and energy; enhances microbial robustness through modulation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), resistance to oxidative stress, and activation of specific genes and transporter proteins; and facilitates biofilm and granular sludge formation through modulation of adhesion and EPS. Additionally, weakening of QS mechanisms reduces membrane fouling and mitigates sludge bulking by inhibiting community behavior and modulating EPS. It also summarizes reported QS regulatory strategies, including chemical activators/inhibitors, sustainable bioregulation using specific microbes, and engineering approaches for optimizing environmental conditions and design parameters. Future research should focus on deepening understanding, exploring optimization potential, and investigating sustainability and ecological safety to maximize the potential of QS in BWT systems and gain key insights into the application of QS technologies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Along with the development of materials technology, the role of natural fibers is again being looked at by researchers to be used as composite reinforcement materials, especially in building construction. Elastic, strong, abundant, low production costs and environmentally friendly are the advantages of natural fibers. Therefore, the use of natural fiber is one of the efforts to use environmentally friendly material technology to reduce global warming. In-depth conversations, relevant research analysis, and bibliometric literature search are all part of the research technique. The ISI Web of Science database was queried to gather the data for the study, which was then analyzed using the VOS viewer and Bibliometric tools. The findings revealed a rising interest in this subject; for instance, over the past ten years, with a total of 285 publications in 2021 and 168 publications in 2022 but still able to grow. This shows the increasing research interest related to the theme 'natural fiber core of sandwich composites in the use of building materials', as well as showcasing organizations and nations more intimately associated with the subject matter, the authors' significance, as well as making it possible to track the subject's advancement in science and provide direction for future research. © 2024 American Institute of Physics Inc..

AB  - All fields of knowledge are challenged to adopt newer, more sophisticated methodologies to cope with growing complexity. Phenomena under study require further multidisciplinary and mixed methods collaborations to achieve expertise able to improve research strategies and practices. Furthermore, traditional methodological approaches face limits to their analytical reach. Here, we demonstrate opportunities from adopting newer, more sophisticated methodologies in the field of higher education (HE) research by comparing three case studies. We argue that such methods and data innovate the mapping and understanding of global HE. These studies uncover novel field characterizations, enabled via analysis of tens of thousands of HE authors and articles over several decades to assess how journal publication, topics, and levels of analysis (individual, organizational, and system) have evolved. Our results imply that to better understand the future of HE worldwide and to address growing challenges, newer methodological directions and data sources will be key to facilitate more comprehensive examinations of the globalizing field. However, our analysis also highlights the technical and learning challenges in implementing these methodologies; thus, we argue for the need to promote more sophisticated methodological training of current and future generations of HE researchers as well as strengthened collaborations across disciplinary, methodological, and cultural boundaries. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Over the past two decades, Discrete Event Simulation (DES) has significantly influenced Construction Engineering and Management (CEM), leading to the development of sophisticated analytical frameworks. This study analyzes the application and impact of DES in CEM through scientometric, bibliometric, and qualitative analyses of 198 journal articles from the Web of Science database, spanning 2000 to 2023. Employing advanced graph-based and clustering techniques, we uncover patterns of scientific collaboration, co-citation networks, key contributing institutions, influential journals, and the evolution of research themes. Our findings spotlight major research avenues, including lean construction, building information modeling, project planning and control, hybrid simulation, and decision support systems. Anticipating future trends, we predict the integration of DES with emerging technologies such as digital twins, data analytics, cloud computing, and context-aware decision support systems. This study maps the current landscape and forecasts the trajectory of DES's role in advancing CEM towards more integrated, technologically enriched methodologies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives: The rapidly ageing world has placed considerable demands on health and social care. To address this, the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN) have declared action for this decade (2021–2030) to promote healthy ageing. Operationalisation of successful ageing in the oral health context in terms of its dimensions and their interconnectedness was determined. Methods: A citation analysis was conducted following a scoping review to determine oral health's relationship with 5 key dimensions of successful ageing. This included examining the occurrence and co-occurrence amongst dimensions and over time. Specific consideration of citations by country, journal type, and authors through overlay visualisation was performed to map their interconnectedness. Results: The scoping review identified 263 publications covering 1730 specific terms. There was a growing interest in successful ageing in the oral health context, mostly in the past decade (2010 onwards; 65.8%, 173 publications). The dimension of key consideration was “health and ADLs” (activities of daily living); this dimension appeared in 97.3% of publications (n = 256) and was found earliest to emerge, with the greatest link strengths compared to other dimensions. Country-level variations in citation data were observed, and there was good citation interconnectedness between them. Key oracles for dissemination have been medical rather than dental-specific journals. Amongst authors, there was considerable interconnectedness in the field. Conclusions: Findings highlight how successful ageing in the oral health context has been studied, with implications for addressing the significance of oral health to older peoples’ lives in line with the WHO and UN's agenda. Citation analyses identified the “known unknowns” area for further consideration, and these findings have the potential to inform how dental research may best move forward with the successful ageing agenda to bring about translational impact. © 2024

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic made people reevaluate their energy consumption and energy efficiency. It held up a mirror to humanity's opportunistic and ruthless deployment of energy sources. As the city streets went empty and the international air traffic stopped altogether, people witnessed the significant drop in CO2 emissions, realized their dependence upon energy sources, and became aware of global climate change. In addition, with lockdowns and home offices, the demand for energy and the usual peak hours shifted offering a new perspective in energy consumption. The pandemic delivered a devastating blow to the human belief in having the constant and everlasting supply of energy that can be relied upon in everything. All these attracted the attention of researchers focusing on energy consumption and efficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the vast body of academic literature on the topic burgeoned in the past four years yielding many exciting perspectives and viewpoints. Our paper conducts a comprehensive review of this body of literature employing the bibliometric network analysis of 12960 publications indexed in Web of Science database. It demonstrates the potential benefits and challenges associated with implementing energy-saving technologies, altering energy consumption behavior, and implementing novel ICT solutions in a post-COVID world. In addition, it highlights the importance of energy efficiency measures and examines novel technologies that can contribute to a sustainable and resilient energy future. Our findings emphasize the need for robust policies, technological advancements, and public engagement for fostering energy efficiency and mitigating environmental impacts of post-pandemic energy consumption. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Electrochemical methods are increasingly favored for remediating polluted environments due to their environmental compatibility and reagent-saving features. However, a comprehensive understanding of recent progress, mechanisms, and trends in these methods is currently lacking. Web of Science (WoS) databases were utilized for searching the primary data to understand the knowledge structure and research trends of publications on electrochemical methods and to unveil certain hotspots and future trends of electrochemical methods research. The original data were sampled from 9080 publications in those databases with the search deadline of June 1st, 2022. CiteSpace and VOSviewer software facilitated data visualization and analysis of document quantities, source journals, institutions, authors, and keywords. We discussed principles, influencing factors, and progress related to seven major electrochemical methods. Notably, publications on this subject have experienced significant growth since 2007. The most frequently-investigated areas in electrochemical methods included novel materials development, heavy metal remediation, organic pollutant degradation, and removal mechanism identification. “Advanced oxidation process” and “Nanocomposite” are currently trending topics. The major remediation mechanisms are adsorption, oxidation, and reduction. The efficiency of electrochemical systems is influenced by material properties, system configuration, electron transfer efficiency, and power density. Electro-Fenton exhibits significant advantages in achieving synergistic effects of anodic oxidation and electro-adsorption among the seven techniques. Future research should prioritize the improvement of electron transfer efficiency, the optimization of electrode materials, the exploration of emerging technology coupling, and the reduction in system operation and maintenance costs. © 2023

AB  - Transitioning to low-carbon coal power plants is critical in addressing climate change, given the significant contribution of coal-fired power generation to global CO2 emissions. Our understanding of the low-carbon transition in the coal power sector has significantly advanced in recent decades. However, the sector's transition remains contentious due to methodological disparities, inconsistent datasets, and varying assumptions across existing studies, which pose challenges for predicting future research trajectories and actions. To address this issue, we developed a Document-based Information Mining and Statistical Analysis Method, conducting a comprehensive review, bibliometric analysis, and comparative study of 1905 journal articles and 14 databases sourced from international authorities. Our quantitative analysis reveals a notable upswing in publications and international collaborative efforts in coal power transition research, with average growth rates of 8.6%, 9.3%, and 3.7% for authors, countries, and institutions, respectively. These studies depict diverse transition trajectories, projecting global and Chinese coal power capacities ranging from 58-927 GW and 0-395 GW in 2050, driven by six key uncertainties such as carbon budgets and energy demand variations, and advancements in CCUS and renewable technologies. We categorized 44 major coal-dependent countries into three groups based on their engagement with coal power transition research, identified three potential transition patterns aligned with temperature control goals, and outlined four distinct research stages in the evolution of coal power transition. Drawing from these insights, we conclude with valuable perspectives on the expansion of international collaboration, reduction of transition uncertainty, focus for future research, and mitigation of transition risks. © 2023

AB  - Efficiency, a component of performance, refers to how well a decision-making unit utilises its resources in the production process. Education is a complex process with multiple inputs and multiple outputs. In order to make the most of the benefits of education, resources should be used in the best way. This will prevent waste of resources as well as increase the outputs. For these reasons, efficiency in education has become one of the most frequently discussed issues among policy makers, researchers and decision makers in recent years. This study provides a comprehensive review of the growing literature on educational efficiency. This research aims to reveal the structure of the field by addressing the efficiency in education literature from a holistic perspective. The study conducted a biblio-metric analysis with 1315 publications covering the period between 1970 and 2022 obtained from the SCOPUS and Web of Science databases. According to the results of the study, the annual growth rate of efficiency in education literature is approximately 9%. The last 10 years of growth cover more than half of the 50 years of literature. This research revealed the contributions to the field in terms of journals, authors, institutions and countries. The most impactful publications of the field were identified. Among 78 countries, China and the United States have made the largest contribution and collaborations. Data envelopment analy-sis, stochastic frontier analysis, higher education, productivity and performance, technical efficiency, scale efficiency, allocative efficiency, and cost efficiency are the main themes of the field. Research efficiency, ranking, quality, school effi-ciency, competition, e-learning, and education in Europe are the trending topics in the field. © 2024, Ministry Education and Science.

AB  - The integration of thermoelectric generators (TEGs) into industrial processes and multi-generation systems presents a promising solution for recovering low-grade waste heat. This study explores the use of such waste heat in producing green hydrogen, utilizing TEGs as an alternative medium for energy recovery. The hydrogen production methods examined include proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers and alkaline electrolyzers. The heat sources are categorized into geothermal sources, solar energy sources, and general waste heat sources. By incorporating TEGs into hybrid systems, the overall system efficiency and rated power output, as well as green hydrogen production, are significantly enhanced. For instance, a system combining an organic Rankine cycle powered by a geothermal source with a TEG and a PEM electrolyzer can generate 98.37 kg/day of H2 and produce 6781 kW of power, achieving an exergy efficiency of 55.39 %. Additionally, TEGs are employed in hydrogen storage and liquefaction to improve the efficiency of the compression and liquefaction processes by reutilizing waste heat. To provide a comprehensive overview, a bibliometric study using the VOSviewer tool is conducted to highlight the trends in hydrogen production via TEGs, analyzing authors' keywords and index keywords. Moreover, this study presents innovative methods and insights into the efficient recovery and utilization of waste heat for green hydrogen production, emphasizing the potential of TEGs in advancing sustainable energy solutions. © 2024 The Institution of Chemical Engineers

AB  - Purpose: Examination of the scientific literature on cholesteatoma from past to present using bibliometric methods. Methods: A total of 2353 articles on cholesteatoma between 1980 and 2023 were obtained from the Web of Science database and statistically analysed using bibliometric techniques. Results: The journals with the highest number of contributions to the literature were Otology & Neurotology (n = 192), Acta Oto-Laryngologica (156) and Laryngoscope (149). The most impactful journals based on h-index and total citation (TC) counts were Laryngoscope (h:36, TC: 4241), Otology & Neurotology (29, 3141), and American Journal of Otology (26, 2071) respectively. The most prolific author was Kojima H. (n = 49). According to the findings of the Reference Publication Year Spectroscopy (RPYS) analysis, there has been a significant increase in academic interest in Cholesteatoma since its first description in 1959, particularly following the expansion of its definition in 1977. Subsequently, the trend of increased interest has risen rapidly in later years, with notable peaks in research intensity observed in 1989, 2006, and 2011. The highest academic trend occurred in 2006. In recent years, trending topics have included innovative approaches such as diagnostic and imaging methods particularly alongside technological developments, endoscopic surgery, recurrence and complications, prognosis and quality of life, artificial intelligence, and obliteration. Conclusion: In conclusion, the evolution of cholesteatoma and its research priorities reveal temporal shifts and emerging areas of interest over time. Primarily, diagnosis, treatment, and surgical approaches remain central. Additionally, research has expanded to encompass developments in surgical techniques, imaging modalities, cellular biology, pathology, and molecular mechanisms. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Objective: To examine the research status, hot spots, and development trend of virtual vascular intervention simulation training in order to organize the knowledge and support its practice. Methods: Publications on virtual vascular intervention and respective teaching evaluation (2001–2021) were retrieved from Web of Science. Citespace 5.2.R2 and Carrot2 software was used to perform the bibliometric and visual analysis on virtual vascular intervention research networks. Results: Of the 1543 articles retrieved, 1520 were relevant to virtual vascular intervention research. Studies on vascular intervention emerged from 2002 with an upward trend being observed from 2010. The trend peaked between 2019 and 2020 with ∼140 published articles (9.21%) during the period. Spain published most studies (n = 146) followed by USA (n = 99) and England (n = 49). COMPUT EDUC (n = 177; 14.47%) journal publishing the highest number of articles. Among 705 authors, GARRISON D R, MAYER RE, DEDE C, COOK DA had highest publications. The frequent keywords used were “Virtual reality” (n = 105) and “education” (n = 105). Low cooperation between countries, authors’ networks, and relatively stable academic team was noted making clinical application of virtual vascular intervention weak. Conclusion: Considerable growth was observed in vascular intervention therapy using VR technology in the last 20 years. With consistent efforts like strengthening cross-institutional and multidisciplinary collaboration networks, VR based simulation training capability can be increased that in turn can improve the outcomes of complex vascular interventions. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - There is a large body of research on Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) and health in Muslim communities, that can offer insights to promote the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3), which encompasses good health and well-being. Based on recent bibliometric evidence, we hypothesized that RIF research is highly relevant to SDG 3, particularly Targets 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, and 3.5. Therefore, this bibliometric study quantified RIF literature supporting SDG 3 and associated targets over the past seven decades and explored themes and trends. All types of research articles were extracted from the Scopus database from inception to March 2022. Microsoft Excel, Biblioshiny, and VOSviewer were used to qualitatively and quantitatively examine RIF research trends supporting SDG 3 and associated targets. We identified 1729 relevant articles. The number of publications notably increased since 1986, with a dramatic increase in 2019–2020. RIF research predominantly supported Target 3.4 (reducing risk for non-communicable diseases), with research hotspots being diabetes, diabetes medications, pregnancy, physiology, metabolic diseases, and obesity and metabolism. This target was also the most commonly supported by dedicated authors and institutions publishing on RIF, whereas other SDG 3 targets were negligibly addressed in comparison. Our comprehensive bibliometric analysis of RIF literature showed growing support for SDG 3 through positive contributions to half of the SDG 3 targets, although Target 3.4 received the most attention. We also identified knowledge gaps that may shape further research directions on RIF and promote the achievement of SDG 3 in Muslim communities. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.
