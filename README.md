# Bibliometric_Analysis
This repository will help you to do your bibliometric analysis research, but not necessary all of the bibliometric analysis techniques.
On this repository we will be taking a look at a couple of bibliometric analysis techniques which is as follows:
- Total Publication per Year
- Document Type Distribution
- Top 10 Contributing Authors
- Top 10 Keywords

**Requirements**

Before you continue, there is a couple of data that you need to have before using this script. The data is as follows:

- RIS file of the dataset that will be used in this script
- VosViewer Map File, that will be discussed later

To begin your journey, you can do a trial run of the script using the data that is available on this repository

This repository hopefully will be useful to help you on your journey to conduct Bibliometric Analysis research.
